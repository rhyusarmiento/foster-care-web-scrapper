If medical service providers who are not enrolled with MO HealthNet or a MO HealthNet Managed Care Plan are used for a foster youth, the resource provider may have to pay for the services out-of-pocket. Any invoice or paid receipt received by the resource provider for services provided to a foster youth in their home must be submitted to the foster youth’s case manager immediately. Any reimbursement to the resource provider will be from Children’s Treatment Services (CTS) funds.</p><p>The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce a new form, Medical Services Authorization Information Letter, CD-27. The purpose of the CD-27 is to assist resource providers seeking medical services for foster youth from service providers who are not enrolled with MO HealthNet or a MO HealthNet Managed Care Plan.</p><p>In the event that a resource parent uses a medical or mental health provider who is not enrolled with MO HealthNet or a MO HealthNet Managed Care Plan the CD-27 must be presented prior to the foster youth receiving services.</p><p>If a resource family makes plans to travel out of state with a foster youth(s) placed in the home, the foster youth(s) case manager should provide the resource parent with a CD27. The worker should explain the reimbursement review process when a resource provider receives an invoice or has a paid receipt and letter from the medical provider, if applicable, for medical services provided to a foster youth placed in their home.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</li><li>Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.&nbsp;</li><li>Review new Children’s Division form.&nbsp;</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and directed to:</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PDS CONTACT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Elizabeth Tattershall&nbsp;</p><p>573-522-1191&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov\">Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td><p><strong>PROGRAM MANAGER&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Amy Martin&nbsp;</p><p>573-751-3171&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Amy.L.Martin@dss.mo.gov\">Amy.L.Martin@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section1/ch3/sec1ch3sub3.htm\">Section 4 Chapter 6 subsection 1</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section1/ch3/sec1ch3sub3.htm\">Section 1 Chapter 3 Subsection 3</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section1/ch3/sec1ch3sub3.htm\">Section 4 Chapter 24 Subsection 3</a></p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section1/ch3/sec1ch3sub3.htm\">Section 4 Chapter 30 Subsection 4</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS</strong> Employee Access Only on CD Desk Top&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/forms/\">Medical Services Authorization Information Letter, CD-27</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>REFERENCE DOCUMENTS AND RESOURCES&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>RELATED STATUTE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE RULE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>COUNCIL ON ACCREDITATION (COA) STANDARDS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>(List or put N/A if not applicable.)</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES REVIEW (CFSR)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>PROTECTIVE FACTORS</strong> N/A&nbsp;</p><p>Parental Resilience&nbsp;</p><p>Social Connections&nbsp;</p><p>Knowledge of Parenting and Child Development&nbsp;</p><p>Concrete Support in Times of Need&nbsp;</p><p>Social and Emotional Competence of Children</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>FACES REQUIREMENTS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table>\n  </div>"

class=\"p13\">It is the Children’s Service Worker’s responsibility to ensure that children in CD custody receive the appropriate screening, assessment, and follow-up services as necessary. During the screening, staff must either request the physician to complete a Healthy Children and Youth (HCY) examination, or give a copy of the appropriate <a

complete.<span class=\"s4\"> </span>Resource providers who accompany the child to the appointment should be given a copy of the appropriate HCY form by the worker to be completed by the physician.<span class=\"s4\"> </span>If there are no changes medically, or additional medical assistance<span class=\"s3\"> </span>is<span class=\"s3\"> </span>needed,<span class=\"s3\">

</span>the<span class=\"s3\"> </span>child’s<span class=\"s3\"> </span>physician and take appropriate action, if necessary.<span class=\"s4\"> </span>After the HCY exam is completed, the Children’s Service Worker should obtain the medical results and record(s)<span class=\"s1\"> </span>and share the information with the Family Support Team.<span class=\"s4\"> </span>If the resource provider accompanies the child to the health examination, the Children’s Service Worker should obtain the results of<span class=\"s1\"> </span>the<span class=\"s1\"> </span>examination<span class=\"s1\"> </span>from<span class=\"s1\"> </span>the<span class=\"s1\"> </span>resource<span class=\"s3\"> </span>provider<span class=\"s1\"> </span>or<span class=\"s1\"> </span>request<span class=\"s1\">

Planning a schedule for<span class=\"s3\"> </span>visitation should always take into consideration the specific needs and current situation<span class=\"s3\"> </span>of each child or youth, which could mean more visits with some children and youth than<span class=\"s3\"> </span>others.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>It may also mean more face-to-face contact with a child or youth one month<span class=\"s3\"> </span>compared<span class=\"s4\"> </span>to<span class=\"s4\"> </span>another.<span class=\"s6\"> </span>Visitation<span class=\"s4\"> </span>with<span class=\"s4\">

</span>resource<span class=\"s2\"> </span>providers should be topics of discussion when workers and supervisors review case<span class=\"s3\"> </span>progress or challenges during individual

</strong></span><strong>Relationship</strong></p><p class=\"p2\">Visiting with children and youth that are in the care and custody of the Children’s<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Division is important for many reasons.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>The primary purpose of the visit is to assess<span class=\"s3\"> </span>child safety and well-being.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Staff should observe how the child is interacting and<span class=\"s3\"> </span>functioning in their placement environment.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Staff should also discuss how the children<span class=\"s3\"> </span>are doing in all environments including school, visits with parents and/or siblings, social<span class=\"s5\"> </span>settings,<span class=\"s4\"> </span>etc.</p><p class=\"p7\">A core positive outcome of spending time together through visits, whether it be<span class=\"s3\"> </span>worker/child, child/parent, worker/parent resource provider or sibling visits, is having the<span class=\"s3\"> </span>opportunity to gain understanding, trust, cooperation, and problem-solve, as individuals<span class=\"s3\"> </span>continue to build a relationship with one another.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>A relationship that establishes mutual<span class=\"s3\"> </span>respect and dignity, two-way communication and understanding is the foundation for<span class=\"s3\"> </span>best<span class=\"s4\">

</span>Spending<span class=\"s4\"> </span>quality<span class=\"s5\"> </span>time with others, including children, increases the child’s sense that they are valued and<span class=\"s5\"> </span>what<span class=\"s4\"> </span>they<span class=\"s4\"> </span>have<span class=\"s4\"> </span>to say<span class=\"s3\"> </span>is important.</p><p class=\"p2\">Engagement with the child was

in<span class=\"s3\"> </span>open Family-Centered Services (FCS), Family-Centered Out-Of-Home Care (FCOOHC)<span class=\"s2\"> </span>and preventive service cases.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>These tools are designed to assist staff in conducting<span class=\"s3\"> </span>more thorough and comprehensive assessments of family’s history, structure and<span class=\"s3\"> </span>functioning; identifying family strengths, supports and service needs; and translating<span class=\"s3\"> </span>those strengths, supports and service needs into meaningful service plans that reduce<span class=\"s3\"> </span>risk<span class=\"s1\"> </span>of<span class=\"s1\"> </span>future<span class=\"s1\"> </span>child<span class=\"s1\"> </span>maltreatment<span class=\"s1\"> </span>and<span

<em>CD-14 FCS Family Assessment Packet </em>is comprised of the <em>(CD-14) FCS Family<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Assessment, (CD-14A) Family Functioning Assessment/Re-assessment, (CD-14B)<span

former <em>(CS-16) Family Assessment</em>.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>It includes the genogram and<span class=\"s2\"> </span>the ecomap which have been enhanced by adding questions that focus the worker on<span class=\"s3\"> </span>questions pertinent to the family’s history, structure and functioning.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>The pattern of<span class=\"s3\"> </span>behavior, now optional, includes an example to illustrate how dysfunctional patterns of<span class=\"s3\"> </span>behavior lead to negative consequences and how interventions can be applied at<span class=\"s3\"> </span>various entry points to interrupt the cycle of unhealthy patterns.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Systemic family-<span class=\"s3\"> </span>centered tools encourage family engagement and yield rich, essential information about<span class=\"s2\"> </span>the family’s past and present functioning; and their beliefs and concerns about the<span class=\"s3\"> </span>future.</p><p

</strong></span><strong>Family</strong><span class=\"s8\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Functioning</strong><span class=\"s8\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Assessment/Re-assessment</strong><br>&nbsp;</h4><p class=\"p25\"><em>The (CD-14A) Family Functioning Assessment/Reassessment </em>is the most significant<span class=\"s3\"> </span>enhancement to the family assessment and service planning package.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>The CD-14A is<span class=\"s2\"> </span>a comprehensive family functioning assessment tool which assists the worker in<span class=\"s3\"> </span>processing information gathered from the systemic tools, worker observation, provider<span class=\"s3\"> </span>and<span class=\"s1\"> </span>collateral contact,<span class=\"s1\"> </span>family history and<span class=\"s1\"> </span>engagement with<span class=\"s1\"> </span>the family.</p><p class=\"p5\">The CD14A addresses family functioning under nine domains (Basic Needs, Caregiver<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Ability, Educational/Vocational, Physical Health, Mental Health, Substance Use, Family<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Interaction, Criminal/Legal and Child Well-Being).<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Under each domain several related<span class=\"s3\"> </span>sub-factors are listed to prompt the worker to rate each according to the positive or<span class=\"s3\"> </span>negative impact on the family’s overall functioning.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Rating possibilities include: <em>clear<span class=\"s3\"> </span>strength, moderate strength, adequate, moderate need and serious need</em>.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Clear and<span class=\"s3\"> </span>moderate<span class=\"s1\"> </span>strengths;<span class=\"s1\"> </span><span class=\"s4\">and</span><span class=\"s1\"> </span>moderate<span class=\"s1\"> </span>and<span class=\"s1\"> </span>serious<span class=\"s1\"> </span>needs<span class=\"s1\"> </span>are<span class=\"s1\"> </span>documented<span class=\"s1\"> </span>and<span class=\"s1\"> </span>described<span class=\"s1\"> </span>in the appropriate space provided below the sub-factors.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Strengths and needs are<span class=\"s3\"> </span>evaluated, prioritized and addressed in the <em>(CD-14B) Written Service Agreement</em>.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>The<span class=\"s3\"> </span>CD-14A should be conducted primarily with the family, though information helpful in<span class=\"s3\"> </span>rating sub-factors may be collected for a variety of sources during the 30 day timeframe<span class=\"s2\"> </span>in<span class=\"s1\"> </span>which the CD-14A must be completed.</p><h4><strong>CD-14A</strong><span class=\"s1\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>for</strong><span class=\"s1\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Re-assessment</strong></h4><p class=\"p7\">After using the CD-14A for initial assessment for case openings the CD-14A is repeated<span class=\"s2\"> </span>every 90 days until the case is closed as a family functioning re-assessment tool.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>The<span class=\"s3\"> </span>CS-16E Risk Reassessment is also conducted at this time.<span class=\"s5\"> </span>Re-assessment of the<span class=\"s3\"> </span>family every 90 days allows the worker to measure progress or identify changes in sub-<span class=\"s3\"> </span>factors that may impact family functioning in a positive or negative way.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Changes in<span class=\"s3\"> </span>family functioning that raise safety concerns may prompt a worker to conduct a CS-16D<span class=\"s2\"> </span><em>Safety Re-assessment.<span class=\"s3\"> </span></em>Re-assessment should be complete within 30 days of the date<span class=\"s3\"> </span>the family is due for re-assessment.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>E<em>xisting Safety Plan (CPS-1A) procedures remain<span class=\"s3\"> </span>in<span class=\"s1\"> </span>effect and should be utilized<span class=\"s1\"> </span>if safety factors are<span class=\"s1\"> </span>present.</em></p><h4><strong>(CD-14B)</strong><span class=\"s1\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Written</strong><span class=\"s1\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Service</strong><span class=\"s1\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Agreement</strong></h4><p class=\"p8\">The (<em>CD-14B) Written Service Agreement<span class=\"s3\"> </span></em>takes the place of the <em>(CS-16B) Family Plan<span class=\"s2\"> </span>for Change.<span class=\"s3\"> </span></em>The CD-14B is used to document the service plan for FCS cases on intact<span class=\"s2\"> </span>families as well as for the preliminary treatment plan developed at the 72-hour FST<span class=\"s3\"> </span>meeting after a child has been placed in out-of-home care that will cover the first 30<span class=\"s3\"> </span>days the child is in care.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>At the 30 day FST meeting the CS-1 Case Plan/Written<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Service<span class=\"s1\"> </span>Agreement will take its place.</p><p class=\"p8\">Goal and task development questions, found on the CS-16B were included on the CD-<span class=\"s3\"> </span>14B to assist workers in processing and setting measurable, time limited goals<span class=\"s3\"> </span>connected directly to service needs identified on the CD-14A or by a Family Support<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Team.<span class=\"s5\"> </span>The tasks development questions should direct the worker to formulate<span class=\"s3\"> </span>concrete,<span class=\"s1\"> </span>obtainable<span class=\"s1\"> </span>tasks<span class=\"s1\"> </span>designed<span class=\"s1\"> </span>to<span class=\"s1\"> </span>move<span class=\"s1\">

The revision of the medical foster care policy was completed with participation and contribution from pediatricians.</p><p>A youth in foster care who: &nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>is medically diagnosed with extraordinary medical condition(s) and or mental or physical disabilities, and&nbsp;</li><li>requires twenty-four (24) hour availability of a resource provider specifically trained to meet the elevated medical needs, and&nbsp;</li><li>has a diagnosed condition significantly and substantially impairs the youth’s ability to function on a daily basis,</li></ul><p>is eligible for placement in a resource provider home contracted to provide Medical Foster Care services.</p><p>The Medical Foster Care Assessment Tool, CS-10, has been revised to provide clarification of what diagnoses deem a foster youth with elevated medical conditions eligible for a medical resource home. Two sections on the form provide for a comprehensive assessment of eligible need:</p><p>Section II:</p><p>Any one condition identified in Section II qualifies the foster youth for placement in a medical resource home. If the eligibility was determined by a selection in subsection A of Section II, there is no requirement of reassessment, unless the medical condition has changed. Youth determined to be eligible under subsection B through E will require annual reassessment. Documentation regarding the eligible condition is required. Submission of the Physician’s Certification Letter, CD-144, is not required for this section.</p><p>Section III:</p><p>This section is completed by the treating physician as the certification that a medical resource home placement is required. A new form, the Physician’s Certification Letter, CD-144, is the cover letter to attach to the CS-10. The CD-144 and CS-10 are provided to the treating physician <strong>only</strong> if the foster youth does not meet any eligible criteria in Section II, yet the Family Support Team recommends that a medical resource home placement is the best interest for the foster youth. The status of each condition identified in this section is to be reviewed annually to determine continued eligibility for a medical resource home.</p><p>Implementation of revised policy and utilization of the updated forms begins immediately upon publication of this memo. Any foster youth currently identified at the medical level of foster care prior to publication date of this memo will remain eligible for medical foster care and do not require annual reassessment <strong>unless</strong> a re-evaluation is requested by the Family Support Team.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</li><li>Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters and forms as indicated below.&nbsp;</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and directed to:</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PDS CONTACT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Elizabeth Tattershall&nbsp;</p><p>573-522-1191&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov\">Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td><p><strong>PROGRAM MANAGER</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Dena Driver&nbsp;</p><p>573-751-3171&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Dena.Driver@dss.mo.gov\">Dena.Driver@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section4/ch15/sec4ch15index.htm\">Medical Foster Care, Section 4 Chapter 15</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230921092327/https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/forms/index.htm\">FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Medical Foster Care Assessment Tool, CS-10&nbsp;</p><p>Medical Foster Care Assessment Tool Instructions&nbsp;</p><p>Physician Referral Letter, CD-144&nbsp;</p><p>Physician Referral Letter Instructions</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>REFERENCE DOCUMENTS AND RESOURCES&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>RELATED STATUTE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE RULE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>COUNCIL ON ACCREDITATION (COA) STANDARDS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES REVIEW (CFSR)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/philbase.pdf\">PROTECTIVE FACTORS</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Parental Resilience&nbsp;</p><p>Social Connections&nbsp;</p><p>Knowledge of Parenting and Child Development&nbsp;</p><p>Concrete Support in Times of Need&nbsp;</p><p>Social and Emotional Competence of Children</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>FACES REQUIREMENTS</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table>\n  </div>"

The revisions and new materials are a result of recommendations submitted by three Recruitment and Retention Task Force work groups.</p><p>Respite care is the provision of periodic and/or intermittent, temporary substitute care of children who are in the care and custody of the Children’s Division (CD), placed in a licensed resource home (foster, relative or kinship, emergency). The respite plan should serve equally the needs of both the foster youth and the foster caregivers. Using respite is important to reduce placement disruptions and to support safer and healthier homes.</p><p>Missouri Respite Provider Care Training is required before approving a respite vendor to provide services. The training is available on the Internet. The training may be completed self-taught or in an instructor led classroom setting. All new resource provider applicants must complete the Missouri Respite Provider Care Training prior to being referred to a STARS pre-service training class. The training will be credited as an inservice training once the vendor is opened and approved to provide services. Relative and Kinship applicants are not required to complete the respite training prior to licensure. All currently licensed or approved resource parents may complete the respite training for in-service training credit.</p><p>The new respite pamphlet may be printed from Children’s Division E-forms.

The 14 days per year reset upon the anniversary of the placement of the foster youth in the home.</p><p>A unit of respite care is defined as a minimum of 12 hours up to a maximum of 24 hours. Use of career respite care is not to exceed 14 units per child during a 12 month period of time and the additional one weekend a month (2 units). The 12 month period will begin calculating on the date that the child was placed in the resource provider’s home. Upon the one year anniversary date of the child’s placement in that home, the units will reset. Unused units from the previous 12 month period are not rolled over to the new 12 month period. At any time a child is placed in a new provider's home, the respite units reset for that child at the new placement. Local staff will be responsible for tracking the number of units.

The CD-111 provides a uniform process to submit respite units and to monitor the appropriateness of the respite care provider as a respite resource. The worker will make only one payment entry for the respite services per month for the respite care provider in order to avoid duplication errors in data entry. The payment entry (CS-65) needs to be entered by the last day of the month to ensure timely payment to the provider.

According to current Children’s Division policy, Career Foster Parents are<br>encouraged to use respite care for all the children placed in their home, at the same time<br>and frequency regardless of level of care as outlined in Section 4.11.Attachment A. In<br>order to better serve children, foster families, and respite providers, respite care will<br>continue to be provided for all foster children in the CFP home at the same frequency,<br>regardless of the foster child’s level of care. However, respite care <strong>no longer</strong> has to be<br>provided for all children in the CFP home at the same time. Career parents are now<br>given the option to determine the actual time(s) to use respite, based on the individual<br>needs of the child(ren) in their home. Allowing the family to decide which children will be<br>provided respite on a particular day/weekend will be helpful, in that it will allow additional<br>flexibility to meet the needs of the child.

This memorandum provides information regarding revisions to respite care policy found in Section 4 Chapter 17 of the Child Welfare Manual. The revised policy includes the introduction of five new forms; Child Information Form for Respite Provider, CD-110, Respite Provider Evaluation/Payment Invoice, CD-111, Resource Family Exit Interview, CD-112, Respite Unit Tracking Log, CD-113, and Resource Parent Discipline Agreement, CD-119.</p><p><strong>Types of Respite Care&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Children’s Division contracts with respite care providers to provide respite service to a licensed resource home (foster, relative or kinship) in the home of the resource parent, or in the home of the respite care provider. If the service is provided in the home of the respite provider, the resource worker will use the Foster Respite Care Provider Checklist, CS-RC-2, to determine that the home is approved for child placement as set forth in CSR 40-60.040 Physical Standards for Foster Homes. Respite services may be approved as part of an adoption or guardianship agreement.</p><p><strong>Recruitment and Retention</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Resource Family Exit Interview, CD-112, is intended to facilitate the recruitment of those resource parents who no longer wish to provide continuous care and wish to close their foster care license. This form should be given to and discussed with the resource parents at the final home visit. It can also be used to recruit former resource providers that left the agency in good standing.</p><p>The resource worker will provide support and instruction to the respite care provider to encourage and promote retention of this vital resource. Retention activities are outlined in Section 4 Chapter 17 Subsection 3.</p><p><strong>Approval Process&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Respite care providers must be approved by the Children’s Division. Section 4 Chapter 17 subsection 4 outlines the process to follow including background checks, and the completion of the CS-RC-1 and CS-RC-3. Staff are also required to complete the Foster Respite Care Provider Checklist, CS-RC-2 if respite services are to be provided outside the resource parent’s home.</p><p>Respite care providers are required to be fingerprinted every two years. The Children’s Division shall pay for the cost of the fingerprinting. The process for conducting fingerprints is located in Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment A.</p><p>Staff may not approve the application or renewal of any person in which a record check reveals that a felony conviction for child abuse or neglect, spousal abuse, a crime against children (including child pornography), or a crime involving violence, including rape, sexual assault, or homicide, but not including other physical assault or battery was determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>Staff may also not approve the application or renewal of any person who in the past five years has had a court of competent jurisdiction determine a felony conviction for physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense.</p><p>Workers must follow the guidelines for approval outlined in policy and not impose additional requirements on the provider.</p><p>Two additional forms that Respite providers are required to sign are the Resource Parent Discipline Agreement, CD-119, and the Safe Sleep Practices, CD-117.</p><p>If a licensed resource home also has a respite contract and is utilized for respite services, it is important to ensure that licensing capacities and other licensing regulations are met. The providers must demonstrate that they are able to supervise all the children in their care.</p><p><strong>Renewal Process</strong></p><p>Respite care providers must have their contract renewed on a yearly basis. Prior to allowing the contract, Cooperative Agreement for the Purchase of Foster Respite Care Services, CM-10, to be signed, the renewal process for determining approval of the provider for utilization of respite services must be completed. A summary of the previous year’s activity in the home, background checks, and a new CS-RC-2 must be completed. The fingerprinting process is only completed every two years. This process is outlined in Section 4 Chapter 17 Subsection 5.</p><p><strong>Guidelines for Use&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Respite care is designed to provide temporary relief from stressful or emergency situations. It is not to be used for regular child care purposes.</p><p>The resource parent will provide a completed Child Information Form, CD-110, to the respite care provider. The utilization of this new form is to better equip the respite care provider with information about the children they will be taking care of and whom they can contact in case of an emergency.</p><p>If the placement child is identified to be at behavioral level, another trained Behavior Foster Care resource parent must be used for the respite services.</p><p>A unit of respite care for licensed traditional, medical, behavioral, relative and kinship providers is defined as a minimum of 12 hours up to a maximum of 24 hours. Use of respite care is not to exceed 12 units per child during a 12 month period of time. The 12 month period will begin on the date that the child was placed in the resource provider’s home. The 12 units will reset upon the one year anniversary date of the child’s placement. Unused units from the previous 12 month period are not rolled over to the new 12 month period. Local staff will be responsible for tracking the number of units. Tracking will be done with the newly developed Respite Unit Tracking Log, CD-113.</p><p>The capacity of placements the respite provider can have is determined using the information from the CS-RC-2. The resource provider that is only contracted as a respite parent will only provide respite services for a maximum of 6 placements at one time or less depending on the information on the CS-RC-2.</p><p><strong>Respite for Career Providers</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Career foster parents are encouraged to use respite care a minimum of one (1) weekend per month plus 14 days per year. Units are calculated as explained in the Guidelines for Use. A child that is determined to be career level on the Alternative Care Information, SS-61, may only be provided respite services by a provider that has a career license with the Children’s Division. The career respite care provider must have a current Agreement for the Purchase of Respite Care for Career Foster Parents, CM-9.</p><p>The career respite care provider can only provide care for a total of two career level youth at one time including their own career level youth placements.</p><p><strong>Reimbursement for Respite Care&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Respite care providers for Legal Status 1 children are reimbursed $20.00 per unit, per child. Career respite care providers are reimbursed $40.00 per unit per child for those children that are classified on the SS-61 as a career level child.</p><p>The respite payment is processed by the Children’s Service Worker (CSW) via a Children's Services Integrated Payment System Invoice, CS-65. The resource parent will submit the completed Respite Provider Evaluation/Payment Invoice, CD-111, to the CSW within 5 working days of receiving the respite service. The new form, CD-111, provides a uniform process to submit respite units and to monitor the appropriateness of the respite care provider as a respite resource. The worker will make only one payment entry for the respite services per month for the respite care provider. The payment entry using the CS-65 needs to be entered by the last day of the month to ensure timely payment to the provider. A copy of the CD-111 will be retained in the respite care provider’s case file.</p><p><strong>Case Recording</strong></p><p>A case file will be maintained by the licensing/resource worker for the respite care provider similar to a resource provider’s file. The outline for the case recording of a respite only resource is provided in Section 4, Chapter 17.9. If the respite care provider is also a licensed resource home (foster, relative, or kinship) the only addition to the typical resource file as defined in Section 5 Chapter 1.6 - <strong>Recording Guidelines and Record Composition – Resource Provider Records</strong>, will be the respite service specific forms.</p><p><strong>Resource Parent Discipline Agreement&nbsp;</strong></p><p>To be in compliance with the Foster Parent Licensing Regulations, all resource parents are to sign the Resource Parent Discipline Agreement, CD-119. The Children’s Service Worker will go over the form with the applicant(s) and be convinced that the applicant understands and agrees to not using corporal punishment and the forms of discipline listed on the form considered to be unacceptable. The Children’s Service Worker will ask the applicant(s) to agree to a positive alternative method listed on the form. The Children’s Service Worker will obtain the signature of the applicant(s) as confirmation of agreement. The worker and the worker’s supervisor will also sign the form.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION</strong>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</li><li>Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.&nbsp;</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and directed to:</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PDS CONTACT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Elizabeth Tattershall&nbsp;</p><p>573-522-1191&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov\">Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td><p><strong>PROGRAM MANAGER&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Melody Yancey&nbsp;</p><p>573-757-3171&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Melody.Yancey@dss.mo.gov\">Melody.Yancey@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section4/ch17/sec4ch17index.htm\">Respite Care</a> Section 4 Chapter 17</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230921092327/https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/forms/index.htm\">FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS:&nbsp;</a></p><p>CD-110 Child Information Form for Respite Provider&nbsp;</p><p>CD-111 Respite Provider Evaluation/Payment Invoice&nbsp;</p><p>CD-112 Resource Parent Exit Interview&nbsp;</p><p>CD-113 Respite Unit Tracking Log&nbsp;</p><p>CD-113 Respite Unit Tracking Log Instructions&nbsp;</p><p>CD-104 Placement Report for Resource Home Record&nbsp;</p><p>CD-117 Safe Sleep Practices&nbsp;</p><p>CD-119 Resource Parent Discipline Agreement</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>REFERENCE DOCUMENTS AND RESOURCES&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>RELATED STATUTE</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/0ewenrhw7ph4kzkymt4zew87k71xag42\">Licensing Rules of Foster Homes</a>, 13 CSR 35-60.040&nbsp;</p><p>Foster Parent Bill of Rights, RSMo 210.566</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE RULE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>COUNCIL ON ACCREDITATION (COA) STANDARDS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>PA-FC 18 Eighth Edition</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES REVIEW (CFSR)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Service Array and Resource Development Systemic Factor, Item 35, Array of Services</p><p>Service Array and Resource Development Systemic Factor, Item 36, Service Accessibility</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>PROTECTIVE FACTORS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Parental Resilience: N/A&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/philbase.pdf\">Social Connections&nbsp;</a></p><p>Knowledge of Parenting and Child Development: N/A</p><p>Concrete Support in Times of Need: N/A&nbsp;</p><p>Social and Emotional Competence of Children: N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>FACES REQUIREMENTS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table>\n  </div>"

This includes full disclosure of all medical, psychological, and psychiatric conditions of the child. The statute also allows foster parents to have access to any information regarding the child or the child’s family including family history of mental or physical illness, sexual abuse perpetrated by the child, criminal background, fire-setting or other destructive behavior or any other information which is pertinent to the care and needs of the child and to protect the foster or adoptive family.</p><p>Licensed resource parents are members of the professional team, which includes the Family Support Team, FST. Information is shared with the team members to assist in making decisions regarding safety, visitation, service and treatment needs, placement, and other case plan activities. Protected health information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) may be provided to FST members to assist them in ensuring the child receives the proper care and treatment. Resources providers, as part of the FST, have access to all information shared with other FST members such as juvenile officers, Guardian-ad-Litems, and school personnel.</p><p><strong>Court Orders and Court Reports</strong></p><p>Per policy, the resource provider accepting a placement in their home will be provided a copy of the court order placing the foster youth in Children’s Division Custody. The provider shall receive all subsequent court orders while the foster youth is placed in their home until the release of jurisdiction is signed by the judge. The resource provider may also have a copy of the court reports regarding the placement(s) in their home.</p><p><strong>Other Protected Information</strong></p><p>Section 191.656.1(e) RSMo, provides that HIV information about a family member may be released to the resource provider.</p><p>Release of Drug and Alcohol Information is more restrictive than HIPAA. To access information about Drug and Alcohol treatment, an authorization from the individual to disclose must be obtained or a court order specifying the release of this information must be made.</p><p><strong>Sanctions</strong></p><p>Resource parents who fail to comply with the privacy policies and procedures of HIPAA policy will be subject to civil and criminal sanctions and disciplinary actions up to and including revocation of license or approval as well as prosecution in a court of law. Disciplinary actions will become part of the resource parents licensing record.</p><p>Further questions regarding protected information should be submitted to the local privacy officer.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION</strong></p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and<br>directed to:&nbsp;</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PDS CONTACT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Elizabeth Tattershall&nbsp;</p><p>573-522-1191&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov\">Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td><p><strong>PROGRAM MANAGER:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Marta Halter&nbsp;</p><p>573-751-3171&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Marta.Halter@dss.mo.gov\">Marta.Halter@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section4/ch5/sec4ch5sub1.htm\">Selection of Placement Resource and Placement Options, Placement in a Resource Family, 4.5.1&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section4/ch12/sec4ch12sub3.htm\">Agency Arranged Relative or Kinship Care Due to the Children’s Division Legal Custody, 4.12.3&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section4/ch6/sec4ch6sub1.htm\">Out-of-Home Placement Support Activities,4.6.1</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>REFERENCE DOCUMENTS and RESOURCES</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section4/ch7/sec4ch7sub2.htm\">Family Support Team, Section 4 Chapter 7 Subsection 2&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section4/ch4/sec4ch4sub5.htm\">Selections of Placement Resource and Placement Options, Matching the Child’s Needs to the Placement, 4.4.5&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section5/ch2/sec5ch2sub7.htm\">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Section 5 Chapter 2 Subsection 7</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>RELATED STATUTE</strong></p><p>191.656(e), Confidentiality of reports and records&nbsp;</p><p>210.150, Confidentiality of Reports and Records, Exception - Violations, Penalty</p><p>210.566, Foster Parent Bill of Rights&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED FEDERAL REGULATION&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title42/42cfr2_main_02.tpl\">42 CFR Part 2, Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE RULE</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>COUNCIL ON ACCREDITATION (COA) STANDARDS</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES REVIEW (CFSR)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>PROTECTIVE FACTORS </strong>N/A&nbsp;</p><p>Parental Resilience&nbsp;</p><p>Social Connections&nbsp;</p><p>Knowledge of Parenting and Child Development&nbsp;</p><p>Concrete Support in Times of Need&nbsp;</p><p>Social and Emotional Competence of Children</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>FACES REQUIREMENTS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table>\n  </div>"

Designated staff shall abide by all federal laws and state statutes, common law and the Code of State Regulations of the State of Missouri relating to the access and use of these systems. Those designated staff shall also maintain all documentation for a minimum of five (5) years, as required by the DPPA, and make them available to the motor vehicle division upon request.</p><p><strong>The DMV system can only be accessed for CD business purposes.

Once the authorized staff person completes the search, the only information supplied to the worker will be the information provided on the form, and staff should not request other information which may be included in the system as this violates the contractual agreement. No personal information regarding the individual’s driving record will be provided to the worker due to the highly confidential nature of the systems.</p><p><strong>NOTIFICATION PROCEDURE</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>When a search is successful the worker should contact the individual by means of a certified, registered letter. <strong>Due to the confidential nature of a child’s case, no identifying information should be provided in the letter.</strong> The letter may state that the individual’s name was provided to our agency as a parent or relative to a child in our custody as a possible placement resource. If the individual responds to the letter, the worker should verify their identity (by age/social security number/date of birth, or other identifying information as documented on the CD-88). Once the individual’s identity has been verified, the child’s identity can be released. If the individual desires to be considered as a placement resource, staff should proceed by completing a background check on the individual.</p><p><strong>DOCUMENTATION&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Case managers should document all information in the Assessment and Treatment section of their case files and file the form in the Forms Section.

Through this process, all comments and recommendations made by Children’s Services frontline and administrative staff, the Office of State Courts Administrator (OSCA), Juvenile Court personnel, GAL’s, and CASA’s regarding the CS-1 were considered and carefully evaluated during development. Additionally, the revised CS-1 was “tested” in three sites across the state. The end result of everyone’s hard work is a document that meets strict federal requirements but is flexible enough to meet individual circuit requirements.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The CS-16 and the CS-1&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Best social work practice dictates that thorough assessments of the family and child must be done prior to development of the service plan. Needs and strengths identified during assessment, are the basis for service planning with a family.</p><p>Data from the Peer Record Reviews and Practice Development Reviews (PDR’s) demonstrate there can be disconnect between assessments and the service plans developed with families. The Council on Accreditation (COA) site reviews further illustrated the need for improvement in policy and field practice.</p><p>With these facts in mind, policy and practice regarding the CS-1 were examined in depth. Although the previous version of the CS-1 called for a great deal of information gathering, the flow of the form made using the information for the purpose of service planning a cumbersome task. For this reason, the “family assessment” part of the former CS-1 was removed entirely, with the exception of basic demographic family data. The new CS-1 is now a child specific form, as is federally required, which assesses the child’s individual safety, permanency, well-being needs. The family assessment is to be done by completing the CS-16. These forms compliment and partner with each other and <strong>both are to be completed</strong> when working with a family whose child(ren) is in out-of-home care. The CS-16 is currently undergoing revisions so that the formatting of both tools is the same and information gathered in the CS-16 will easily transfer to parts of the CS-1.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CS-1 Enhancements</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:none;\" type=\"none\"><li><em><strong>CS-1 as a Court Report</strong></em>&nbsp;</li><li>The CS-1 has been redesigned so that information gathered and entered into the document logically leads to summary sections which can be quickly located in the document and utilized by the court. These summary sections are outlined in bold throughout the document. When properly completed, these summary sections should provide most, if not all, of the critical information the court will need during a review: child and family data, summary of reasonable efforts to prevent placement, summary of reasonable efforts to facilitate reunification and provide permanency, summary of visitation, and summary of appropriateness and child/youth adjustment to placement. In the event the court needs more detailed information about the summary sections, that information can easily be found in the document right before each summary section.</li><li>The final two sections of the CS-1, FST (Family Support Team) Data and Recommendations and the Written Service Agreement, are also outlined in bold for quick identification by the court.&nbsp;</li><li>Ideally, the court will accept a completed CS-1 as a court report. In circuits where the CS-1 is not accepted as a court report, the summary sections (when completed according to forms instructions) can easily be cut and pasted into a narrative report for the court.&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>CS-1 as an Electronic Document&nbsp;</strong></em></li><li>The CS-1 has been redesigned to be a dynamic form. In other words, the CS-1 grows as information is continuously added over the life of the division’s involvement with the child. The CS-1 will no longer be printed and stored at the warehouse but will be stored electronically on the computer hard drive. After a CS-1 for a child is initially created, that CS-1 can be saved and retrieved later. In any subsequent CS-1, only new information or information which has changed must be entered in the document.&nbsp;</li><li>The new electronic CS-1 has “Add” buttons embedded in eight locations within the document. Clicking on these “Add” buttons allows additional lines to easily be added to the form making it “grow” as additional space is needed for future case information. The “Add” buttons allow the addition of new family members, service information, relative/kin options explored, placements, FST participants, and goals and tasks over the life of the division’s involvement with the child. When a reviewer of any kind retrieves the most recent CS-1 from the case file, they will be able to quickly see all the primary details for that individual child. In the cases where TPR must be pursued, most information needed can be easily located in last CS-1 because it has been gathered and entered.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>System Requirements for the CS-1&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In order to be able to use all the features of the new electronic CS-1, staff must have MS Office XP (2002) installed on their computer. This is the standard version all Children’s Division staff should have installed. If this is not the version of Word installed on your computer, please contact your local Regional Site Coordinator (RSC) or Area Technical Coordinator (ATC) for assistance. .&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Standardized Permanency Options</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The ASFA statute specifies five permanency options, in order of preferred legal permanency, for children who are in alternative care: Reunification, Adoption, Guardianship, Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative, and Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA). These permanency options and language are also included in the Missouri Supreme Court's Resource Guide for Best Practices in Child Abuse &amp; Neglect Cases. In an effort to standardize the language used when discussing permanency for children, these permanency options have been added to the revised CS-1 in the FST Data and Recommendations section.&nbsp;</p><p>Next to ensuring safety, meeting a child’s permanency needs is the single most important function performed by our agency. Permanency planning permeates every aspect of the child's placement in out-of-home care. The goal of out-of-home care is to provide to every child a stable and continuous relationship with nurturing adults. Acceptance of this goal implies that no child should be allowed to drift in out-of-home placement. The child should either be reunified with his/her parents or be freed from parental custody and placed for adoption within a definite time limit. When neither of these alternatives are possible, one of three plans is utilized to secure permanency for the child; Legal Guardianship; Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative; or Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA).&nbsp;</p><p>Three of the permanency options; Reunification, Adoption, and Guardianship; are already addressed in current policy. Revisions to the forms instructions for the CS-1, Child Welfare Manual (CWM) Table of contents, CWM Section 4 Chapters 8, 9, 10, 12, 23, and Chapter 23 Attachment A reflect the addition of the other two permanency options to policy.&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:none;\" type=\"none\"><li><em><strong>Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative</strong></em>&nbsp;</li><li><p>Choosing this option is appropriate when it is documented for the court that compelling reasons exist which make all other permanency options unacceptable. <strong>Relative placement does not prevent adoption or guardianship</strong>. If the child is with a relative who wishes to care for the child long-term, adoption and guardianship should still be explored as they offer more permanence than simple placement through the court. Additionally, a relative placement need not take precedence over a stable placement with another individual who may wish to adopt or become the child’s guardian.&nbsp;</p><p>This permanency option should be selected only under these circumstances:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Return home has been ruled out;&nbsp;</li><li>TPR and adoption or guardianship are not appropriate and the juvenile court and/or Division feels it is in the best interest of the child not to pursue termination;&nbsp;</li><li>All relatives have been considered and there is an identified relative resource who is willing to make a permanent commitment to care for the child;&nbsp;</li><li>The relative resource is able to meet the child’s physical, emotional, and developmental needs;&nbsp;</li><li>The child wants to be placed with the relative;&nbsp;</li><li>The relative has been fully informed of the legal effect of the placement and all available financial resources, including adoption or guardianship subsidies;&nbsp;</li><li>The parent(s) has been informed about the placement of the child with relative provider;</li><li>If the relative plans on continuing contact with the parent from which the child was removed, they are prepared to protect the safety of the child and make decisions that enhance child’s well-being about the child’s contact with this parent;&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><p>Placement with a fit and willing relative, without adoption or guardianship, <strong>is not a legally final permanency option</strong>. Therefore, the court must continue to hold annual permanency hearings until the court enters a legally final permanency order (return of child to legal custody of parent, TPR and adoption or guardianship) or the child reaches age 21.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA)&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>APPLA is the least preferred permanency option. This option is a <strong>specific permanent placement</strong> for the child, not just a foster care placement that can be indefinitely extended. Choosing this option is appropriate when it is documented for the court that compelling reasons exist which make all other permanency options unacceptable and not in the best interests of the child. Examples include when there is a significant bond, but the parent cannot care for the child due to disability; and when an Indian tribe has identified an APPLA for the child.&nbsp;</p><p>An APPLA should be selected as the most appropriate permanency option <strong>only</strong> under these circumstances:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Return home has been ruled out; &nbsp;</li><li>TPR and adoption or guardianship are not appropriate;&nbsp;</li><li>The child objects to TPR, and the juvenile court and/or Division believes it is in the best interest of the child not to pursue termination;&nbsp;</li><li>Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative has been ruled out;&nbsp;</li><li>There is an identified appropriate planned permanent living arrangement in which the child wishes to continue living;&nbsp;</li><li>All possible additional services are explored with the child and/or the placement provider to provide permanency;&nbsp;</li><li>The out-of-home care provider will make a formal Planned Permanency Agreement with the Division for this purpose.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>As with Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative, an APPLA <strong>is not a legally final permanency option.</strong> It is subject to ongoing court review. Therefore, the court must continue to hold annual permanency hearings until the court enters a legally final permanency order (return of child to legal custody of parent, TPR and adoption or guardianship) or the child reaches age 21. Just as court hearings should explore more permanent options for the child, members of the FST should continue to explore ways in which the child’s permanency and stability can be enhanced. <strong>To summarily rule out more permanent options based on the child’s age or needs is contrary to the goals of ASFA</strong>. Individual determinations about each child’s needs and circumstances are necessary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The following do not qualify as an APPLA:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Extended Out-of-Home Care or Long-Term Foster Care.</em> The ASFA statute explicitly <strong>prohibits</strong> long-term foster care as a permanency option. This is not considered a permanent living situation for a child. Long-term foster care is not stable and may disrupt, often leading to frequent moves and instability for the child and instability. All language in the CWM which refers to Extended Out-of-Home Care has been removed.</p><p><em>Emancipation.</em> Emancipation is unfortunately what sometimes happens when children leave foster care. It is not a permanency goal because it lacks certain permanency features contemplated by APPLA. Emancipation implies a discharge from foster care simply by virtue of one’s age without the necessary support system to provide sustained stability for the youth.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Independent Living.</em> Independent Living is a set of services provided to a youth, not a permanency goal. A youth’s APPLA may include independent living classes and other services as part of their permanent plan. An APPLA implies not just simply making a youth “independent”, but implies a broader plan that includes a support system the youth can continue to access while in care as well as once they are no longer in custody.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Information regarding the above material about Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative and Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement is credited to Making It Permanent: reasonable efforts to finalize permanency plans for foster children / by Cecilia Fiermonte and Jennifer L.

Revisions to the SS-61 fields are currently in progress. Until such time that the SS-61 fields and code sheet can be updated and as of October 1, 2003, staff should use code 06 in field 16 for Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement and code 08 for Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative.

Revisions to the SS-61 code sheet reflecting this change will be forthcoming.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Planned Permanency Agreement&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Previously called the “Extended Out-of-Home Care Agreement”, a Planned Permanency Agreement should be completed whenever either of the two permanency options, Placement with a Fit and Willing Relative or APPLA, is selected for a youth.

The new Application for Fair Hearing, CD53, will be used for all grievances made by a Children's Division applicant or provider who disagrees with a decision regarding the Children's Division services listed below. Those individuals who have grievance regarding Family Support Division services will continue to use the IM-87 form.</p><p>The Application for Fair Hearing, CD-53, is to be used by an applicant who is dissatisfied with the action taken on their application or by a provider who disagrees with a proposed action on their license or subsidy. A hearing may also be requested if the claimant believes a change in subsidy benefits should have occurred.</p><p><strong>The Fair Hearing process is to be used for the following:</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Foster/Relative/Kinship Home License Denial/Suspension/Revocation&nbsp;</li><li>Adoptive Home Denial&nbsp;</li><li>Adoption Subsidy Maintenance Denial/Change&nbsp;</li><li>Adoption Subsidy Services Denial/Change &nbsp;</li><li>Legal Guardianship Subsidy Denial&nbsp;</li><li>Residential Child Care and/or Child Placing Agency License Denial, Revocation or Suspension</li></ul><p><strong>Fair Hearing Process</strong></p><p>To initiate the fair hearing process, the foster/relative/kinship/adoptive or foster/adoptive care applicant/provider must notify the Children’s Service Worker in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action, CS-20a, indicating the request for a Fair Hearing. CD-53 and the Withdrawal of Request for Fair Hearing, CD-54, will be in the same mailing as the CS-20a.</p><p>The worker will attempt to resolve the issue with the applicant informally while concurrently preparing for the Fair Hearing. The worker shall arrange an administrative review within ten (10) working days of receipt of the request. Participants in the meeting should include the resource provider, the Circuit Manager/Designee, appropriate Regional Director/Designee and Supervisor. The purpose of this meeting is to:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Review information provided by the applicant or resource provider and Division staff to see if the issue can be resolved prior to filing a request for a Fair Hearing.</li></ul><p>Once the Children’s Service Worker has received a written request from the resource provider requesting a Fair Hearing, the Children’s Service Worker shall advise the Regional Director/Designee of this request and automatically forward the CD-53 to the Hearings Unit at Division of Legal Services (DLS) within one (1) working day after the date of the hearing request. The worker will also submit a Hearing Packet which includes three copies of the CD-53, a copy of the recommendation summary and the adverse action letter. To expedite the hearing process, the worker must ensure the CD-53 is complete with accurate information and includes all necessary signatures. The Children’s Service Worker shall provide one copy of the case record materials that directly relate to the action upon request to the applicant/resource provider.</p><p>The worker shall complete the CD-53 for the applicant if requested. If the worker completes the CD-53, the worker must be specific as to the reason a hearing is being requested. The applicant does not need to sign the form prior to the request being forwarded to the DLS Hearings Unit; however, the applicant's signature must be obtained prior to the actual hearing.

The following are definitions within the legislation that impact the RPPS.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Caregivers are defined as foster parents with whom a child in foster care has been placed.&nbsp;</li><li>Occasional is defined as once per week or less on varying days, and not exceeding twice per month.&nbsp;</li><li>Short-term is defined as no more than 72 consecutive hours.</li></ol><p><strong>Discussion</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Georgia Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) is responsible for the safety, permanency, and wellbeing of children served. The goal of the RPPS is to offer children and youth in foster care as \"normal\" a childhood experience as possible. DFCS works in partnership with foster parents to accomplish this goal. Within that partnership, foster parents are empowered to make typical parenting decisions without having to obtain administrative approvals from DFCS or a Child Placing Agency (CPA).&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, the RPPS required caregivers to notify DFCS/CPA prior to children in DFCS custody participating in overnight activities exceeding two nights. However, the passage of House Bill 912 now authorizes caregivers to arrange occasional short-term babysitting for children placed in their home for up to 72 consecutive hours as long as certain other requirements are met. Caregivers may exercise this authority for purposes such as medical or other health care appointments, grocery or other shopping, personal grooming appointments, special occasions, foster parent training classes, school related meetings, business meetings, adult social gatherings, or an occasional evening event out.&nbsp;</p><p>Safety is always paramount so caregivers must ensure that their caretaking decisions support all aspects of a child's safety (i.e. physically and emotionally), including when selecting and arranging for babysitters. Babysitters must be at least 18 years of age and able to provide the appropriate level of care for each child left under their supervision. Caregivers shall make all reasonable efforts to provide babysitters with the following before leaving a child for occasional short-term babysitting:</p><ol><li>Any information about the child's emotional, behavioral, medical and physical condition necessary to provide care for such child during the short-term babysitting period;&nbsp;</li><li>Any medication that should be administered to such child in foster care during the short-term babysitting period; and&nbsp;</li><li>Emergency contact information that is valid for the duration of the short-term babysitting period.</li></ol><p>Lastly, caregivers must notify DFCS/CPA (verbally or in writing) prior to a child in DFCS custody being left under the care and supervision of a babysitter for more than 72 consecutive hours. The notice shall identify who will be serving as the babysitter, where the babysitting will occur (e.g. in the foster home), and when the babysitting period will begin and end. This basic information is needed to monitor compliance with the 72-hour timeframe and for emergency preparedness. Regardless of how the notice is received, it must be documented in the case record. Please note that this change has no impact on DFCS policy regarding paid respite care.</p><p><strong>Implementation</strong></p><p>This CWSCL is available on the Online Directives Information System (ODIS) at <a href=\"http://odis.dhs.ga.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">http://odis.dhs.ga.gov/</a>.

The addition of Chapter 22 supports the agency's implementation of the Kinship Continuum.</p><p><br><strong>Discussion</strong></p><p>The Georgia Division of Family and Children Services is responsible for ensuring the safety, permanency and well-being of children served. When children cannot remain safely with their parents, DFCS recognizes that children thrive best with kin (relatives and fictive kin), and through the Kinship Continuum prioritizes kinship caregivers as the preferred and best option for children. This includes the use of voluntary kinship arrangements to prevent children from entering foster care, and kinship foster care placements when children must enter foster care. Research shows that kinship care reduces trauma to the children by maintaining their family connections, traditions, a sense of belonging, and identity. Further, kinship care increases placement stability and permanency for children and creates an opportunity to strengthen the family. The following sections of the Child Welfare policy manual have been created or revised to support DFCS' implementation of the Kinship Continuum.</p><p><br><strong>Chapter 22

The policies in this chapter were relocated from policy 5.7 Investigations: Special Circumstances. In addition, special circumstances policies in Chapter 3: Intake and other sections of the manual were updated to align with the Chapter 20.   &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Discussion    </strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Georgia Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) is responsible for ensuring the safety, permanency, and wellbeing of children served. DFCS recognizes that sound policies support the framework for providing effective child welfare services. To that end, DFCS continually reviews and makes responsive changes to the Child Welfare Policy Manual to assure continued alignment with federal and state laws, organizational changes, shifts in best practice and socio-cultural factors affecting children and families served.</p><p>Special circumstances are unique situations outlined in federal and/or state law that requires DFCS’ assessment and intervention. While some special circumstances involve allegations of child abuse, many do not. However, each special circumstance requires specific actions to ensure child safety, well-being and/or permanency. The creation of Chapter 20: Special Circumstances provides comprehensive guidance through dedicated policy sections for each type of special circumstance.

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>DISCUSSION:</p><p>The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify policy and practice, and introduce a log for conducting a Purpose Code “X” screening. This screening is a specific type of criminal background check that uses the Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System (MULES). Children’s Division (CD) staff typically request a Purpose Code “X” screening to determine the appropriateness of a potential placement for a child who has been taken into emergency protective custody. The Division has received clearance from the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) to allow for Purpose Code “X” screenings to also be requested in response to exigent circumstances, which involve a child who is already in the care and custody of CD, or where a placement disruption has occurred and a perspective relative or kinship provider has come forward to request placement consideration.&nbsp;</p><p>Exigent circumstances refer to an emergency, a pressing necessity, or a set of circumstances requiring immediate attention or including situations when: time is of the essence; the health and safety of a child is involved; or, action is necessary to ensure the best interest of the child. Exigent circumstances do not include routine foster or licensed care situations, visitations with relatives or kin, or for the purposes of a child or older youth to attend a sleep-over with friends.&nbsp;</p><h4>Process for Completing a Purpose Code “X” Screening&nbsp;</h4><p>If there is a need to complete a Purpose Code “X” screening for emergency placement or exigent circumstances, staff should adhere to the following process:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>The Children’s Service Worker or juvenile officer must request the local law enforcement to search the MULES for anyone 17 years old or older residing in the household;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>In accordance with Section 210.482.2 RSMo, a child should be immediately removed from the home in which he/she has been placed if anyone 17 yearsold or older refuses to provide fingerprints.&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Fingerprints must be submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with days of the MULES check. To meet that deadline, the CD Worker must provide th placement provider with information to schedule their screening with the contracted electronic fingerprint vendor; &nbsp;</li><li>The requesting agency will be responsible for maintaining a Purpose Code “X” Log to document the screening and subsequent fingerprinting process.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The law enforcement agency is not responsible for ensuring the legitimacy of the request. Law enforcement is required to ensure the requestor is an authorized representative, and upon verification, the inquiry should be performed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Staff shall no longer use Purpose Code “X” background screenings in conjunction with safety planning or the voluntary placements of children by their parents.</strong> This would include any case in which a child has not been placed in the custody of CD. The Division could lose the privilege to use Purpose Code “X” background screenings should this practice continue. Staff should use background screenings through FACES, and continue to complete walkthrough observations of household environments to assure the safety and well-being of child(ren).&nbsp;</p><p>There is a way <strong>outside </strong>of Purpose Code “X” which can be utilized for the purpose of safety planning with families in response to reported concerns of child abuse or neglect. Law enforcement is able to share criminal history information with the Division during the course of a co-investigation, outside of completing Purpose Code “X” screenings. Local protocols should be established regarding the sharing of this type of information, and staff should ask law enforcement if Purpose Code “X” was used, so CD can log and process those situations. There is no need to log information shared outside of Purpose Code “X”.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Documentation of Purpose Code “X” Screenings&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>The Purpose Code “X” Request Log, CD-153, has been developed for local offices to complete and maintain in order to track the use of Purpose Code “X” screenings and the subsequent fingerprinting of those whose background was screened using Purpose Code “X”. Staff will also need to document situations when fingerprints were not completed and the reason they were not completed by indicating “No Placement” on the Purpose Code “X” Request Log. This resource form may be found in the CD Forms folder of your computer desktop.&nbsp;</p><p>MSHP completes audits to verify the appropriate use of Purpose Code “X” screenings on behalf of the FBI. The Purpose Code “X” Log, CD-153, will be used in response to any such audit. Staff may also need to review appropriate case records if additional information is needed to respond to questions concerning the use of a Purpose Code “X” screening or the subsequent fingerprinting process.&nbsp;</p><p>Law enforcement is required to ensure that anyone requesting a Purpose Code “X” screening is an authorized representative of an agency entitled to make such a request. Local offices should work with their multidisciplinary teams to establish protocols to fulfill the required verification process.</p><table style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0px;color:rgb(21, 21, 21);display:table;font-family:var(--serif);font-size:1.2rem;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:1.15;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;max-width:100%;orphans:2;overflow-x:auto;padding:0px;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;width:930px;word-spacing:0px;\"><tbody style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><tr style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><td style=\"font-size:1rem;margin:0px;padding:10px;\" colspan=\"2\"><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\">NECESSARY ACTION</strong></p><ol><li><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and directed to:</p></li></ol></td></tr><tr style=\"background-color:rgb(243, 243, 243);margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><td style=\"font-size:1rem;margin:0px;padding:10px;\"><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\">PDS CONTACT</strong></p><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Scott B.

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>DISCUSSION:</p><p>This memorandum introduces the new resource suspension code, Administrative Hold. Administrative Hold is to be used in responding to certain licensing situations which will more effectively serve resource parents, the Children’s Division and most importantly, the safety of children. All suspensions on the Vendor Licensure/Placement Resource form, SS-60, require notification of an adverse action which is open to appeal. The Administrative Hold status has been added as it reflects a less punitive and less negative connotation and is not open for appeal in the Fair Hearing process.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on the nature of the allegation in a Child Abuse and Neglect (CA/N) report and the risk assessment, a provider may be placed on Administrative Hold with a corrective action/support plan implemented and no other children placed in the home until the issue is resolved and the Hold status is removed. If no immediate safety risk factors exist to the children during the investigation/assessment, the children currently in the home should not be removed. If, at the time of the investigation/assessment (I/A), it is determined the child will be removed, either at the request of the resource provider or by the investigator, the Children’s Service Worker (CSW) should be notified in order to schedule a Family Support Team meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>The Family Development Specialist should be having and documenting their regular, ongoing discussions with the resource provider regarding any licensing concerns prior to a change in their licensing status. Child Welfare Manual (CWM) Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment B states that written notice, specifying the reasons for denial or revocation shall be provided ten (10) days prior to the effective date of the action. For an Administrative Hold the licensing worker should notify the provider via a phone call as soon as possible. A follow-up letter should then be sent explaining why the Hold is in effect and how it can be removed/resolved. If the Hold was requested by the provider, the licensing worker should follow up with a letter verifying their request.</p><h4>ADMINISTRATIVE HOLD&nbsp;</h4><p>The Administrative Hold is required in the following circumstances:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>An Out-of-Home investigation (OHI) is under way involving Legal Status 1 children in the resource provider’s home. The Administrative Hold should remain in effect until the investigation is concluded and all corrective actions/support plans, if any, are successfully completed and documented in the record.&nbsp;</li><li>A CA/N investigation/assessment is under way involving non-Legal Status 1 children in the resource provider’s household. The Administrative Hold should remain in effect until the I/A is concluded and all corrective actions/support plans, if any, are successfully completed and documented in the record.&nbsp;</li><li>Licensing concerns have been noted and a staffing is under way. The Administrative Hold should remain in effect until all corrective actions/support plans, if any, are successfully completed and documented in the record.&nbsp;</li><li>A resource provider moving to another county/circuit should be placed on Administrative Hold and not receive any additional placements pending the completion of the license transfer process. The circuit from which the provider has moved should notify the receiving circuit of the change in address and provide necessary information on current placements, and transfer records within one week. The receiving circuit should schedule a home visit within two weeks of notification. After the provider’s new home has been inspected and approved, relicensure should be granted. The Hold status should be removed from the Vendor Licensure/Placement Resource Report, SS-60, and provider records updated to reflect the changes.&nbsp;</li><li>The resource provider has experienced a significant change (in household composition, health, employment, etc). The Administrative Hold should remain in effect until the provider’s situation has been reassessed and the study has been updated. Every effort should be made to complete these actions within 2 weeks, per the Council on Accreditation (COA). The worker should document all attempts to meet this timeframe, including the provider’s specific actions of noncompliance within that time.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The Administrative Hold status is available, but optional in a variety of circumstances, such as, but not limited to:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>The provider has had a new birth and needs time to adjust.&nbsp;</li><li>The provider feels they need “a break”.&nbsp;</li><li>The Family Support Team has recommended that the resource provider cease new placements during the period of adjustment for an adopted child.&nbsp;</li><li><p>The resource provider has a biological/adopted child placed in residential care. Per memo CD05-22, no additional children will be placed in the home without the approval of the Circuit Manager (CM) or designee. The guidelines stated in Section 4 Chapter 5 Attachment C should be reviewed and assessed as the provider may need time to work with the child placed in residential care. If there are questions whether an Administrative Hold or Suspend status should be implemented, staff should consult with first or second level supervisors for guidance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ol><h4>SUSPEND/REVOCATION&nbsp;</h4><p>Suspend/Revocation is defined as an action which is taken:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>In response to a CA/N report or Preponderance of Evidence finding to be applied during the time of the investigation/assessment and the allegation is severe enough to warrant removal of a child.&nbsp;</li><li>As an action to be taken when revocation is recommended:&nbsp;<ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Suspend/revocation is used whenever children in the home have been found to be in imminent risk.&nbsp;</li><li>Suspend is used when the resource parent is not complying with licensing requirements and efforts (such as, but not limited to, being placed on Administrative Hold) to remedy the situation have failed (i.e.: refuse to keep training requirements current, refuse to meet licensing standards, or continued non compliance with an Individual Support Plan).&nbsp;</li><li>Suspend is used when a staffing has been held, and licensing violations are of sufficient magnitude to warrant a recommendation of suspend.&nbsp;</li><li><p>Suspend is used during the period of evaluation and consideration of amelioration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ol><h4>UPDATES TO SS-60 FORM, INSTRUCTIONS AND CODE SHEET&nbsp;</h4><p>System changes have been added to Legacy/Production which allow the Administrative Hold code, ‘H’, to be entered in field 27 on the Vendor Licensure/Placement Resource Report form, SS-60, whenever this action is used. The system will no longer allow input of a vendor number for a placement change when that vendor is on Hold or Suspend status. An error message will appear at the bottom of the ZCC3 screen stating the vendor status is either on Hold or Suspended.

The bill did provide for exceptions for requests required under the provisions of subdivision (6) of section 210.481, RSMo; section 210.487, RSMo; or section 571.101, RSMo. Requests made under these sections, which includes requests for records for the purpose of foster/relative/kinship care licensing, will remain at $14.00. However, it does not provide for an exception for records requested for the purpose of adoption. Thus, the cost for background checks completed for the purpose of adoption has increased to $20.00. The fee for respite providers, parents and family members who are not being printed for the purpose of licensure has also increased to $20.00.&nbsp;</p><p>A line of information entitled “Reason Printed” has been added to the electronic scan registration letters for foster, relative, kinship, and adoptive parents and applicants. The reason printed for licensing purposes would be 210.487 RSMo. This code would be utilized for all initial background checks and for license renewals. The reason printed for the purpose of adoption would be 43.540 RSMo. This code would be utilized for all background checks completed as part of an adoptive study. The letters for respite providers and parents do not have the Reason Fingerprinted added as they do not fall under either statute and they are responsible for making their own payment.&nbsp;</p><p>The electronic scan letters have been updated and a new letter has been created for adoptive parents. These are now available on your desktop or through eforms on the Children’s Division website. Please dispose of all copies of the old letters you may have and begin using the new letters with the date of this memorandum.</p><table style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255,

The Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action letter is to be utilized when such an action is being recommended regarding a licensed or approved home or an application for resource home licensure or adoptive home approval.&nbsp;</p><p>Staff are to begin using the updated CS-20a effective with the date of this memorandum.

A copy should be retained in the provider’s files in the Correspondence Section.&nbsp;</p><p>The CS-20a previously stated that if a provider wanted to request a Children’s Services Fair Hearing, they must make the request in writing to the county office address listed within 10 working days of the date of the certificate of mailing on the CS-20a. The Foster Home Licensing Rules state that if a written request for a hearing is received within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the notice, a hearing will be provided. The change to the CS-20a brings the Children’s Division process into compliance with the foster home licensing rules.</p><table style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255,

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>REFERENCE: CHILDREN’S DIVISION&nbsp;</p><p>DISCUSSION:</p><p>The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce changes in policy due to revisions in the foster home licensing rules, changes to the Foster/Adopt Home Assessment Application (CS-42) and the Resource Home and Safety Checklist (CS-45). The foster home licensing rules went into effect on January 30, 2007, and staff are to conduct all new licensing and renewals according to the revised licensing rules as of the date of this memorandum. Any currently licensed home must meet these requirements as their license is renewed. Staff should be addressing these changes with all licensed homes during their quarterly home visits to prepare resource providers for the changes they will need to make prior to their license being renewed. All contractors must also comply with these licensing criteria for homes they develop for their use or for those developed for the Division’s use under the Foster Care and Adoption Resource Services (FCARS) contract.&nbsp;</p><p>FOSTER HOME LICENSING RULES&nbsp;</p><p>The foster home licensing rules are located in the Child Welfare Manual, Section 6, Chapter 2, Attachment B. This section has been updated to reflect the revised licensing rules. The licensing rules are included in the Code of State Regulations and can be found on the secretary of state’s website (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240320191929/https://www.sos.mo.gov/\">www.sos.mo.gov</a>). The foster home licensing rules were previously included in Division 40 – Division of Family Services. This has now changed to Division 35 – Children’s Division.&nbsp;</p><p>This memorandum will address the changes from the previous licensing rules except for those changes which relate to the foster home licensing emergency rule which went into effect in August, 2006. These changes were addressed in memorandum CD06-77 and will be addressed further in a forthcoming memorandum. The changes are addressed in the order in which they appear in the licensing rules.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>13 CSR 35-60.010 Family Homes Offering Foster Care&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The changes to this section were the addition of the fingerprint background check information, the issuance of one license per household, suspension of a license, and utilization of the home.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Fingerprint Background Checks – this change adds the requirement of fingerprint based background checks for all household members aged 17 and older as well as any child under age 17 that has been certified as an adult for the commission of a crime or has been convicted or pled guilty or nolo contendere to any crime.&nbsp;</li><li>One License per Household – only one license will be issued per household. This means that a couple must be married in order for both persons to be included on the license. It also means that if more than one adult, no matter the relationship between the adults, lives in the household, only one may be licensed; for example a mother and adult daughter living in the same household, only one may be licensed as a foster parent. However, all adults living in the household who will have child care responsibilities must attend pre-service training but are not required to attend in-service training, although we would encourage them to do so.&nbsp;</li><li>Suspension of License – this addition requires the Division to provide written notification to a licensee ten (10) days prior to their license being suspended and allows the provider to request a hearing and review. Thus, the Foster/Relative Home Action Report (CS-20) and the Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action letter (CS-20a) notifying the licensee of the action taken must be completed for all suspensions as it is for all denials and revocations. These forms can be found in the Children’s Division e-forms.&nbsp;</li><li>Utilization of home – this is a new piece to this section and states that the granting of a license does not guarantee placement. It also states that all placement decisions will be made at the discretion of the Children’s Division and Juvenile Court in the best interest of the child based upon the totality of circumstances with parental preferences taken into consideration. This is to allow for CD and Juvenile Court staff to take into consideration the qualities and living situation of all potential placements and the preferences of the parents to make the best placement choice for the child. The foster family profile will be utilized in this process. Parental preferences alone should not prevent a potential placement resource from being selected. This is a decision that should be made with the Family Support Team.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>13 CSR 35-60.020 Number of Children&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Changes to this section include the following:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Language regarding dually licensed homes – the Division’s policy has been that no licensed foster home who is also licensed as a child care provider may have a foster child under the age of seven (7) in their home unless necessary to accommodate a sibling group. This change now places this policy into rule.&nbsp;</li><li>Applicants and currently licensed homes must notify the Division of any contracts held for the care of children at the time of application or gained after licensure.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>13 CSR 35-60.030 Minimum Qualifications of Foster Parent(s)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There are significant changes to this section which include, the age of foster parents, citizenship status, competencies, a physician’s statement at license renewal, immunizations, training, home study information, and the foster family profile.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Age of Foster Parents – this change adds language to the rule that allows for the licensure of a person under age 21 in the case of relative and kinship placements.&nbsp;</li><li>Citizenship Status of Foster Parents – this has been added to the rules and requires that all persons seeking to be licensed by the Children’s Division must be a citizen of the United States or be able to verify lawful immigration status. All persons seeking licensure must provide a valid Social Security card or a Legal Immigrant Card (“green card”). All persons here legally have had a background check completed by the federal government prior to receiving their green card and their information is available in the FBI database. Therefore, a criminal background check may be completed on these individuals. Identix Identification Services, the contracted electronic fingerprint provider in Missouri, will accept a green card as identification for the purpose of completing background checks.</li><li>Competencies – this addition to the Personal Qualifications for Foster Parents requires that foster parents be able to acquire and demonstrate performance based competence in each of the five competency areas (Protecting and nurturing; Meeting developmental needs; Supporting relationships between children and families; Connecting children to relationships intended to last a lifetime; and Working as a member of a professional team) and for re-evaluation of their abilities in these competencies at each license renewal.&nbsp;</li><li>Physician’s Statement – this change adds the requirement of having the foster parent’s physician complete the Resource/Adoptive Family Medical/Health Report (CW-215) not only at the time of initial licensure but also at the time of renewal.&nbsp;</li><li>Immunizations – requires that all family members be up to date on their immunizations. If anyone in the household is not up to date on immunizations, the family must provide a statement from their family physician that the health of foster children is not at risk.&nbsp;</li><li>Training – requires the completion of a competency based training approved by the Division for pre-service and adds the requirement of in-service training hours for license renewal.&nbsp;</li><li>Home study information – requires the collection of personal information for the purpose of completing a home study on the foster family. The information gathered will include, but is not limited to,&nbsp;<ol><li>Family size and household composition of the foster family;&nbsp;</li><li>Ethnic and racial background of the foster family;&nbsp;</li><li>Religious preferences and practices of the foster family;&nbsp;</li><li>Lifestyles and practices, including sexual orientation, of the foster parents;&nbsp;</li><li>Educational practices of the foster family; and&nbsp;</li><li>Employment of the foster parents.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:none;\" type=\"none\"><li>This information will be collected during the initial assessment and must be updated at each license renewal assessment. Changes in some of these categories will require the home study to be updated within two weeks of the Division being notified of the change (changes to household composition, employment and address changes must be updated immediately per COA requirements). This requirement was previously addressed in memorandum CD06-49.&nbsp;</li></ul><ol start=\"8\"><li><p>Foster Family Profile – all of the information gathered for the home study will be condensed to comprise a foster family profile which will be utilized by the Family Support Team to assist in making placement decisions in the best interest of the child. A forthcoming memo will address this requirement in more depth.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p><strong>13 CSR 35-60.040 Physical Standards for Foster Homes&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Changes to this section include:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>The cost of testing for a private water supply is to be the responsibility of the applicant or licensee. If the water supply is found to be unsafe for human consumption, an alternative source of drinking water is to be made available;&nbsp;</li><li>The addition of swimming pools to the list of hazards which may require fencing;&nbsp;</li><li>Clarification of age six and two (children age six (6) and older of the opposite sex are not to sleep in the same room and children age two (2) and older shall not sleep in the same room as foster parents);&nbsp;</li><li>The foster home must have an operable phone or CD approved form of emergency contact;&nbsp;</li><li>Requires smoke detectors in the home to be operable with batteries installed;&nbsp;</li><li>Increases the required capacity of fire extinguishers in foster homes from 2 ½ to 5 pounds; and&nbsp;</li><li>Requires carbon monoxide detectors in all households with gas appliances.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>This section also has new Weapons Requirements for foster homes which include:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Any and all firearms and ammunition shall be stored so as to be inaccessible to children. Foster parents shall store ammunition separately from any weapons. Firearms and ammunition shall be stored in locked areas or cabinets with keys secured so as to be inaccessible to children.&nbsp;</li><li>No firearms shall be kept in any vehicle transporting foster children (unless weapons are inaccessible to the foster child – i.e., in a locked glove box or other locked container or in the trunk of the vehicle) or on any person providing care or supervision to foster children. (An exception will be made for any person transporting a foster child who must carry a weapon as part of their job responsibilities – i.e., law enforcement officers.)&nbsp;</li><li>No firearms possessed in violation of a state or federal law or a local government ordinance shall be present at any time in the home, on any household member, or in any vehicle in which the children are riding.&nbsp;</li><li>Weapons storage shall be made available for external viewing by Children’s Division staff in order to assure weapons are inaccessible to children.&nbsp;</li></ol><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:none;\" type=\"none\"><li>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>13 CSR 35-60.050 Care of Children&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The changes to this section include the requirement of the foster parents to:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Participate in the Family Support Team (FST) meetings via physical attendance or via written or oral input;&nbsp;</li><li>Notify the division within two weeks of any pertinent changes in their family situation (changes in household composition, marital status, employment, address, phone number, arrests, convictions, guilty pleas, etc.);&nbsp;</li><li>Maintain medical and school files on foster children;&nbsp;</li><li>“Act as the parent” on behalf of a foster child in the development of an IEP;&nbsp;</li><li>Comply with all FST recommendations and court orders regarding visitation plans; and&nbsp;</li><li>Support the foster child’s cultural identity and individuality in foster care.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The Education and Training piece of this section has the most significant changes as it outlines that the educational and vocational plan for the foster child shall be determined by the FST, including at a minimum the legal custodian or representative of the licensed child placing agency, the parent(s), foster parent(s), juvenile officer, and child of appropriate age, twelve and above.&nbsp;</p><p>The changes to this section also include the removal of the requirement for foster parents to provide allowances for foster children.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>13 CSR 35-60.060 Records and Reports&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The changes to this section include requirements for the Division and its staff. These requirements include:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Develop a record on each foster child to be given to the foster parent(s) at the time of placement;&nbsp;</li><li>Provide additional information on the child to the foster parent(s) as it becomes available to the Division and outlines the content to be included in the record;&nbsp;</li><li>Provide an after hours contact number for the case manager; and&nbsp;</li><li>Provide all medical and dental information on the foster child including psychosocial and mental health history.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The contents of the record are listed in the Child Welfare Manual Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment B.&nbsp;</p><p>RESOURCE HOME AND SAFETY CHECKLIST&nbsp;</p><p>The Division has a responsibility to assure the safety of the children in division care and to do so, all homes providing care to our children will now have a Resource Home and Safety Checklist (CS-45) completed prior to licensure or the placement of a child. The CS-45 was previously the Kinship Home and Safety Checklist. This form has been adapted so it may be utilized for all of our resource homes and is attached along with instructions.&nbsp;</p><p>Changes have also been made to the CS-42 Application for Foster/Adopt Home Assessment which include&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Reorganization of the form,&nbsp;</li><li>Removal of the statement regarding the release of the information contained in the form,</li><li>Changes the law violation section to Legal History, and&nbsp;</li><li>Addition of a Child Abuse and Neglect History,</li></ol><table style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0px;color:rgb(21, 21, 21);display:table;font-family:var(--serif);font-size:1.2rem;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:1.15;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;max-width:100%;orphans:2;overflow-x:auto;padding:0px;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;width:930px;word-spacing:0px;\"><tbody style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><tr style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><td style=\"font-size:1rem;margin:0px;padding:10px;\" colspan=\"2\"><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\">NECESSARY ACTION</strong></p><ol><li><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Any questions regarding this e-mail should be sent through normal supervisory channels. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Share information from this memo with all licensed alternative care providers.&nbsp;</p></li></ol></td></tr><tr style=\"background-color:rgb(243, 243, 243);margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><td style=\"font-size:1rem;margin:0px;padding:10px;\"><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\">PDS CONTACT</strong></p><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Stefanie Wickers&nbsp;</p><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">573-751-1354&nbsp;</p><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><a href=\"mailto:Stefanie.D.Wickers@dss.mo.gov\">Stefanie.D.Wickers@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td style=\"font-size:1rem;margin:0px;padding:10px;\"><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\">PROGRAM MANAGER</strong></p><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Melody Yancey &nbsp;</p><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">573-526-8040&nbsp;</p><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><a href=\"mailto:Melody.Yancey@dss.mo.gov\">Melody.Yancey@dss.mo.gov<strong>&nbsp;</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></td></tr><tr style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><td style=\"font-size:1rem;margin:0px;padding:10px;\" colspan=\"2\"><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><em><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\">CHILD WELFARE MANUAL</strong></em><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\"> REVISIONS</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section4/ch12/sec4ch12sub2.htm\">Section 4 Chapter 12.2</a> &nbsp;

These changes are contained in the Child Welfare Manual, Section 5, Chapter 1; and Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment M. Attachment M is a new addition to the manual.&nbsp;</p><p>DOCUMENTATION OF EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE&nbsp;</p><p>Email has become a typical form of communication for our staff. We utilize this form of communication to relay information regarding cases to other Division staff, Juvenile Court personnel, placement providers, and attorneys. While we are using this form of communication more often, it still tends to be less formal in nature. The informality associated with this form of communication can create problems when staff are trying to adequately document case activity. Therefore, guidelines for the recording and documentation of email correspondence is being added to the Child Welfare Manual, Section 5, Chapter 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Email correspondence pertaining to a case must be included in recording and documentation. The email message shall be printed and included in the correspondence section of the case file. Staff should also note in the narrative section that contact was made with an individual through email in the narrative section but the content of the message does not need to be included. Since email correspondence shall be included in the case file, staff should give the same consideration to the content as they would for letters and other forms of correspondence. Only information pertaining to the case should be included in the message and discussion of topics unrelated to the case should not be contained within the message.&nbsp;</p><p>Staff are reminded that this form of correspondence is open to release when a request is made for a file. Since email may be released with the rest of the file, it is important that staff are careful to only include necessary and pertinent information.&nbsp;</p><p>Personal information and commentary regarding case members or others involved in the case is not appropriate for this type of correspondence and should be left out. It is also important for best practice that only one case be discussed in each email. This means when consulting with a supervisor, Juvenile Officer or attorney regarding multiple cases, multiple emails should be sent. If email is received from another party discussing numerous cases, a copy of the correspondence should be placed in each case file with the names and information regarding the other cases redacted from the copy. Notation should be made in the narrative as to why there is information redacted from the correspondence.&nbsp;</p><p>SET UP AND MAINTENANCE OF PROVIDER RECORDS&nbsp;</p><p>Guidelines have now been established for the set up and maintenance of provider records. These guidelines are contained in Section 5, Chapter 1, of the Child Welfare Manual. Case recording for resource provider records should be completed quarterly and signed by the Children’s Services Worker responsible for licensing of the family. Documentation should include, at a minimum, the dates of quarterly home visits and who was seen at the visit, current number and type of placements, changes in household composition, licensing concerns, and progress on the Professional Family Development Plan. Quarterly home visits must be conducted by the licensing worker or another approved staff member and should not be conducted by the Children’s Services Workers for the foster children in the household. Quarterly documentation should also address any identified safety issues. The case narrative and documentation should be reviewed and signed quarterly by the supervisor for the worker responsible for licensing the home.&nbsp;</p><p>ROLE OF THE WORKER&nbsp;</p><p>The role of the Children’s Services Worker responsible for licensing resource providers is to coordinate the licensing and maintenance of all foster, relative and kinship care homes. This coordination includes recruitment, training, and support of foster, relative and kinship care providers. It also includes addressing any concerns (i.e. licensing violations or failing to meet the competencies) with the providers and assuring the home continues to meet licensing standards. A list of job duties related to resource provider licensing are contained in Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment M, of the Child Welfare Manual.&nbsp;</p><p>Changes have also been made to Section 6 Chapter 3.1 in order to comply with <a href=\"http://dssweb/cs/standards/servicestds/21.pdf\">Council on Accreditation standard S21.10.05</a>. The changes made to this section were addressed in memorandum <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/memos/2006/49/cd0649.pdf\">CD06-49</a>, and require the assessment (home study) to be updated within two weeks when significant changes within the foster, relative or kinship home are brought to staff’s attention.</p><table style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255,

These changes are located in the Child Welfare Manual Section 6 Chapter 3.&nbsp;</p><p>Foster, relative and kinship homes are licensed to provide care to the children in the Division’s custody. Homes that are licensed but not accepting placements inflate the numbers of available homes and mask the issue of lack of available placements for children in the Division’s custody.</p><p>The Division takes the placement of children very seriously and as such want to have licensed only those homes that are actively accepting and providing for alternative care placements. Therefore, the Division is establishing a protocol and guidelines for the closing of licenses for those homes that have not had a placement for the last 12 months or longer.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time of license renewal, the Children’s Services Worker responsible for licensing should identify those homes which have not had a placement in the last 12 months or longer. Once a home is identified, the worker should contact the family to arrange a face to face meeting. At this meeting, the worker should discuss the reason why the family has not had a placement during the past year or longer.&nbsp;</p><p>For foster care providers, the worker should discuss the reason why the foster parent(s) has not had a placement during this time frame as well as discussing the types of children needing foster care placement. The goal should be to work with the family so they are ready to take foster care placements. A plan can be made to address the concerns of the foster parent(s) and/or the Division. The foster parent(s) may attend additional training or may be utilized for respite care to address placement concerns. The Professional Family Development Plan should be utilized for this process. Information on the Professional Family Development Plan is located in the Child Welfare Manual <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2attachc.htm\">Section 6 Chapter 2 Attachment C</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The worker should begin the process for closing the license only after working with the foster parent(s) to reach an agreement on placing children in the home and discussion with the worker’s supervisor. The worker should complete the form CS-20 Foster/Relative Home Action Report. These will be considered a voluntary relinquishment of the license, unless licensing violations are present and impact the decision to close the license, and staff should mark “other” in the reason for the license relinquishment. Staff should explain that the foster home has not had placement for the last 12 months or longer and that an agreement could not be reached for the placement of children in the home. If the foster family does not agree with closing the license, it should be suspended until such time as the family will accept children or license closing or revocation can be completed. Once the CS-20 is completed and approved, staff should update the SS-60 to show the license has been closed. The close reason used should be “04 – Vendor Resource Discontinued Service”. An exception can be made for Teaching Foster Parents who are not currently accepting placements since the contract for Teaching Foster Parents requires them to have a current license.&nbsp;</p><p>For relative and kinship care providers, the worker should determine if the providers may be utilized for the identified child(ren) in the future. The license may be kept open if there is a possibility that the relative/kin child(ren) may return to the home. If the worker and supervisor feel the family is appropriate for consideration, they may also discuss with the provider the needs of the circuit for alternative care providers to determine if the provider is interested in becoming a licensed foster home. The license should be closed if neither of these criteria is met. The closing procedure is the same as noted above.</p><table style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0px;color:rgb(21, 21, 21);display:table;font-family:var(--serif);font-size:1.2rem;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:1.15;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;max-width:100%;orphans:2;overflow-x:auto;padding:0px;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;width:930px;word-spacing:0px;\"><tbody style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><tr style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><td style=\"font-size:1rem;margin:0px;padding:10px;\" colspan=\"2\"><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\">NECESSARY ACTION:</strong></p><ol><li><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Any questions regarding this e-mail should be sent through normal supervisory channels.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">Share information from this memorandum with all currently licensed alternative care providers.

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>DISCUSSION:</p><p>The purpose of this memorandum is to inform staff of updates to policy and procedures regarding development of new placement types, and corresponding updates to the SS-60 Vendor Licensure/Placement Resource Report and SS-61 Alternative Care Client instructions, code sheets and forms. In the past, the Children’s Division has been unable to identify placement providers of children in the system in a Court Ordered (CTO) relative or non-relative placement. New codes have been added to better identify and track all children who are court ordered in a relative or non-relative kinship placement or in foster home placements.</p><h4>CTO CONVERSION PROCESS&nbsp;</h4><p><strong>All current CTO placements with a relative (C) or non-relative (D) subtype must be converted to one of the new Relative (RH) or Kinship (KH) codes by January, 31, 2006. Effective immediately staff will no longer be able to enter any new placement subtypes of CTO-C or D on the SS-61.</strong> The current CTO-C or D subtypes will continue to appear on the SS-61 turnaround until all conversions have been completed. A system generated listing of children in those placements will be sent to Regional Directors and Quality Assurance (QA) Specialists each month until all conversions have been completed. The QA Specialists have been trained on the CTO conversion process and will support Circuits in training and assisting staff with the conversions.&nbsp;</p><h4>NEW CODES&nbsp;</h4><p><strong>Placement Codes on SS-61 (Field 47):&nbsp;</strong></p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>RHU- an unlicensed Relative Home&nbsp;</li><li>KHU- an unlicensed Non-Relative Kinship Home&nbsp;</li><li>KHO- a licensed Non-Relative Kinship Home&nbsp;</li><li>KHB- a licensed Behavioral Non-Relative Kinship Home&nbsp;</li><li>KHM- a licensed Medical Non-Relative Kinship Home&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Due to the volume of children currently in CTO-C or D placements it is anticipated there will not be a high number of new KHO, KHB or KHM placements. Many of the conversions may be either RHU or KHU placement types. The conversions will then more accurately reflect an increase of children placed in relative or kinship homes as desired by our Program Improvement Plan (PIP).&nbsp;</p><p>For the purpose of differentiating relative versus non-relative placements: <strong>a Relative (RH) placement signifies the child and placement provider are related by blood, marriage or adoption. A Kinship (KH) placement signifies there is no blood, marriage or adoption relationship but a close relationship exists between the child and kinship provider.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Staff shall also check the appropriateness of the current placement type for ALL children in ACTS. Those children living with a relative but are currently tracked as FHO must be changed to accurately reflect a relative placement type. If children are placed with a relative, the only appropriate placement types are: RHO, RHB, RHM, RHU or ADR.&nbsp;</strong></p><h4>NEW LICENSURE CODES ON SS-60 (FIELD 24a)&nbsp;</h4><p>Per CD policy, Section 6 Chapter 3, an unlicensed placement provider can receive a maintenance payment of state-only funds for 30 days if they are pursuing licensure. Those providers already in the system as CTO-C or D must decide whether or not they want to be licensed, complete training and enter into a contractual agreement with the CD. If the provider does not want to be licensed, staff will still need to complete the SS-60 to obtain a vendor number. Staff will need to check vendor screens, VNME and VNMA, in PROD to verify the placement provider does not already possess a vendor number. If the vendor already has an assigned vendor number, that Departmental Vendor Number (DVN) should be used to update the SS-60. If there is no vendor number, an SS-60 will need to be completed in order for the placement provider to be assigned a DVN. Field 24a on the SS-60 is a new field to document the vendor’s <strong>Licensing Status</strong> of:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:none;\" type=\"none\"><li>1=the vendor meets licensing and training requirements&nbsp;</li><li>2=the vendor is pursuing licensure&nbsp;</li><li>3=the vendor is not pursuing licensure or maintenance&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Code ‘1’ will correspond to placement types: KHO, KHB, KHM, RHO, RHB, and RHM. If the vendor’s license has expired and the vendor chooses to meet licensing requirements, they must apply for a new license before this field can be updated.&nbsp;</li><li>Code ‘2’ will correspond to placement types: RHU and KHU ONLY. If a vendor is pursuing licensure, the vendor can be updated to reflect when licensure has been completed to Code ‘1’. If it is determined the vendor does not meet licensure requirements or later chooses not to receive maintenance, the vendor should be updated to Code ‘3’.&nbsp;</li><li>Code ‘3’ will correspond to placement types: RHU and KHU ONLY. Vendors classified as a Code ‘3’ do not meet licensure requirements or opt not to be licensed. These vendors are not eligible for maintenance.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The licensing status entered in Field 24a on the SS-60 determines the maintenance code in Field 56 on the SS-61.

We previously submitted fingerprint cards to the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) for processing. However, MSHP awarded a contract to Identix Identification Services (IIS) to provide electronic fingerprint scanning services in Missouri. This service is known as <strong>Missouri Applicant Processing Services</strong> or <strong>MOAPS</strong>. The Children’s Division began utilizing this service in July, 2005. This service is also utilized by in home child care providers who are monitored through the Office of Early Childhood. Information on the use of the electronic scan service by in home child care providers can be found by referencing Memo <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/memos/2005/49/cd0549.pdf\">CD05-49</a>, dated 08/17/05.&nbsp;</p><p>This memorandum is to outline the changes made in policy regarding:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>The submission of fingerprints;&nbsp;</li><li>Review the process for using MOAPS;&nbsp;</li><li>Review the letters to be provided to applicants for scheduling purposes; and&nbsp;</li><li>Establish a process for conducting group scan sessions.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The Child Welfare Manual has been updated to include the new electronic scan process. These changes were made to Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachments A, D, and H. The electronic scan process should be the only process utilized; however, there may be specific situations in which the previous card and ink method may be used. This should be done in rare cases only, such as homebound adults living in a foster, relative or kinship home. Staff should be aware that results on card and ink prints may take as long as 3 months to be returned. We are currently averaging 10 weeks for card and ink results. The rejection rate is also much higher using this method. Therefore, staff should provide sufficient time for these results to be returned so there will not be a delay in issuing or renewing a license. No provider should be issued a license prior to the criminal background check results being received.&nbsp;</p><p>Applicants may schedule their appointments either by phone or through the Identix website. The process for registration is as follows:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Contact MOAPS to schedule the appointment.&nbsp;<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>To schedule by phone, call 1-866-522-7067.&nbsp;</li><li>To schedule via the Internet, go to <a href=\"http://www.identix.com/iis\">www.identix.com/iis</a>.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>The applicant will need to identify the reason they are being printed and that is to provide foster care for the Children's Division. Respite providers and biological parents will need to state that they are being printed at the request of the Children’s Division.&nbsp;</li><li>MOAPS staff will request additional identifying information. This information includes:&nbsp;<ol><li>&nbsp;Full name _______________&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Date of Birth _______________&nbsp;</li><li>Social Security Number _______________&nbsp;</li><li>ORI number <strong>M0920360Z&nbsp;</strong></li><li><p>OCA code _______________&nbsp;</p><p>(The OCA field must be provided to the applicant by the local office prior to the applicant contacting MOAPS. The OCA codes were previously provided to all counties.)&nbsp;</p></li></ol></li></ul><p>Once MOAPS has collected the information, a date and time for the appointment will be set. Applicants may view available sites on the IIS website. This information may be located by going to <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/memos/2005/49/cd0549.pdf\">www.identix.com/iis </a>and clicking on<strong> Missouri</strong>. This will take you to the Missouri information page. Under the <strong>Current Project Status</strong> heading, there is a link within the text titled <strong>Missouri location web page</strong>. This will show all current locations and the number of days available for scanning.&nbsp;</p><p>The process information listed above should be provided to all applicants by utilizing one of the letters previously provided to counties. There are letters for alternative care providers, biological parents, respite care providers and private agencies. The letters for alternative care providers, biological parents and respite care providers are attached. These letters include the ORI and OCA information which are the components necessary for adequate billing process. It is important to be sure that the appropriate OCA code is utilized so our alternative care providers will not be charged for their prints. There are separate letters for biological parents and respite providers as we do not cover the cost of those prints. The cost to them for utilizing MOAPS is $50.95, which includes the fees of $24 for FBI, $14 for MSHP, and $12.95 processing fee. Identix is able to determine whether to bill the Division or charge the applicant the fees based upon the OCA code provided by Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</p><p>The Division may pay for criminal background checks for relative studies being done through ICPC if the family is completing the licensure process. Relatives not completing the licensure process will be responsible for payment for the background screening. The Division will not pay for the background checks on any individuals residing with the biological parent(s). Specific questions regarding the ICPC process should be directed to the ICPC unit in Central Office.&nbsp;</p><p>Identix offers on-site scanning for groups of 30 or more. Children’s Division staff may arrange this service by contacting Identix Identification Services at 573-592-7169 or 941-730-4766. The current IIS staff member handling these requests is Christine Devore. Staff should give 2-3 weeks notice when arranging an on-site session. Staff will need to decide whether applicants will complete forms for submission to Identix or enroll online for the on-site scanning. IIS will work with staff to make these arrangements and to schedule the sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>If a county is experiencing delays in receiving background results, they may contact Martha Witt in the Background Screening and Investigation Unit at 573-751-3448 or <a href=\"mailto:Martha.S.Witt@dss.mo.gov\">Martha.S.Witt@dss.mo.gov</a> or Stefanie Wickers in the Quality Improvement and Field Support Unit.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION:</strong></p><ol><li>Review with all Children’s Division staff</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><strong>PDS CONTACT:</strong><br>Stefanie Wickers<br>573-751-1354<br><a href=\"mailto:Stefanie.D.Wickers@dss.mo.gov\">Stefanie.D.Wickers@dss.mo.gov</a></td><td><strong>PROGRAM MANAGER:</strong><br>Cindy Wilkinson<br>573-751-3171<br><a href=\"mailto:Cindy.R.Wilkinson@dss.mo.gov\">Cindy.R.Wilkinson@dss.mo.gov</a></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS:</strong><br><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch3/sec6ch3attacha.htm\">Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment A</a><br><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch3/sec6ch3attachd.htm\">Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment D</a><br><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual_test/section6/ch3/sec6ch3attachh.htm\">Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment H</a></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>RELATED STATUTE:</strong><br>RSMo 210.487</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE RULE:</strong><br><a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/xqrif356v4c5nk1oi8fbf2p9vk6lqx0z\">State Code of Regulations Title 13 Division 40 Chapter 60</a></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>COUNCIL ON ACCREDITATION (COA) STANDARDS:</strong><br>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><p>PN/SW:js3</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>DISCUSSION:</p><p>The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify qualifications of an Independent Living Arrangement (ILA) as a placement type, new requirements, and introduce a new review process. The changes are effective with this memo. Missouri reports data annually on youth in ILA placements and this placement type must meet the requirements as outlined in the Child Welfare Policy Manual to avoid audit findings that result in a Program Improvement Plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Youth in Independent Living Arrangements, while often viewed as doing well and being capable of living “independently”, need as much if not more support than youth in other placement types as there is not a resource parent in the young person’s life and they often have limited personal connections. Effective with this memo, youth in an ILA placement must have two contacts per month, at least one in person in their living environment. As ILA is the only placement type in which there is not a resource provider involved, this level of contact is a necessary next step to help improve outcomes and successful transition of youth exiting state custody.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Youth Criteria:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Youth in an ILA should have a goal of Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA) and must be receiving Chafee Services prior to the placement being made. Although licensure is not involved, an ILA is a planned and approved living arrangement that must meet certain criteria to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the youth. Youth in an ILA should be able to demonstrate competency in life skills, manage his/her own finances, demonstrate responsible conduct, and are attending school and or working. An FST or Team Decision Making Placement Stability meeting shall occur prior to a youth moving into an ILA.</li><li>Youth in an ILA must be at least 18 years old; in Missouri, youth under the age of 18 are not allowed to enter into a lease agreement, which is vital to provide housing stability. Youth who are 17 may be considered for ILA if they have 2 obtained their high school diploma or HiSet. Youth who are still attending high school are typically not able to focus on the demands of sustaining an ILA residence thus they should be referred for the Transitional Living Program instead.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Household Composition:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Youth in an ILA are allowed to have roommates, however, ILA is not to be used as a substitute for relative licensure to provide a form of maintenance for the family, including the biological parent whose rights have been terminated. Placement with a safe supportive adult is always ideal over an Independent Living Arrangement whenever possible. If placement with an adult caregiver is the plan for the youth, another placement code should be used instead of ILA.&nbsp;</li><li>ILA shall not to be used in situations where the youth is living with a parent. Foster Care is a form of substitute care for children whose safety or well-being requires they be removed from the home of their parent(s). If the parent of the foster youth resides in the home, the foster youth is no longer “removed from the control of his parents” per RSM0 211.011 nor is the youth “unattended by parent” per RSMo 210.481(4).&nbsp;</li><li>ILA shall not be used as a placement with friends or family members who are unable to meet licensure requirements. If an adult exercises authority over the youth or has in the past, or the youth is paying “rent” to a family member or former foster parent while residing in the same residence, this is not an appropriate ILA placement.&nbsp;</li><li>A youth in an ILA shall not be providing supervision or authority over any other youth residing in the home. Consequently siblings of youth in an ILA may not be “placed” with the youth as an ILA placement. If a sibling meets all of the ILA requirements, the siblings may however reside together as housemates. For example, a 15 year old and an 18 year old may not reside together in ILA placements as a 15 year old does not meet the age requirements. However, an 18 year old and a 19 year old sibling may reside together as they both meet the age requirements for ILA. Youth working on their own successful transition from foster care should not be put in a position of having parental authority over a sibling, and youth under the age of the ILA requirements are in need of parental authority.</li></ul><p><strong>Service and Supervision Provisions:</strong></p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>If a youth resides in a community program that provides living arrangements such as Job Corp, this is an ILA placement and the youth shall receive maintenance directly to them as they are living independently. The youth may visit a resource family on the weekend however the majority of the time the youth is residing in a program and thus it is not a foster care placement.&nbsp;</li><li>Youth in an ILA shall not “rent” a room or apartment from a foster parent or parent. ILA is meant to be a community setting for independence. Renting from a parent or foster parent can result in complications as these persons have had authority over the youth in the past and leave the youth in a vulnerable position, such as homelessness, should the relationship change.&nbsp;</li><li>If a youth is case managed by an agency outside of Children’s Division or Foster Care Case Management, such as the Department of Mental Health or a group home program that is not licensed but in which staff reside, this is not an ILA. Youth in an ILA should be able to manage their own physical and mental health needs on a daily basis, are able to come and go on their own, and have entered into a lease agreement to reside in the dwelling. Youth who qualify for an ILA should have a plan to exit to independence, not to the care of another agency.</li><li>There are some community agencies providing services similar to transitional living program services via an apartment or a group home setting that are not licensed and contracted with Children’s Division to provide this service. These programs are not approved to provide services for youth in foster care so youth should not be placed with them and coded as an ILA. Staff in these facilities are not monitored by Children’s Division. If a youth is in need of a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220516062510/https://dss.mo.gov/cd/older-youth-program/contracts-services.htm\">Transitional Living Program</a>, a referral shall be made with an agency who is contracted with Children’s Division to provide this service.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Steps To Be Taken:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>New Tools:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Two new tools have been developed to be used in conjunction with the <a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/k4zh5m0zzjdvwevjlhh7gusur13yl5au\">CS-TLP1</a> for placement in an ILA: Independent Living Arrangement Checklist, CD-282 and the SelfDeveloped Case Plan for Independent Living Arrangement, CD-283.&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>The ILA Checklist, CD-282 has been developed for use with all youth currently residing in or being considered for an ILA placement.

The Independent Living Arrangement Checklist, CD-282 and the <a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/k4zh5m0zzjdvwevjlhh7gusur13yl5au\">CS-TLP-1</a> shall be completed each time the youth moves to a new ILA to ensure the living environment is safe and meets ILA requirements. The checklist should be reviewed quarterly by the case manager and the supervisor during case consultation. If a youth is determined to not meet the criteria for an ILA placement, the coding shall not be used.&nbsp;</li><li>The Self-Developed Case Plan for Independent Living Arrangement, CD-283 is used to assist with preparation and budgeting for an initial ILA placement.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Prior to Placement:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Moving forward, for any new placements in which ILA is being considered, <strong>PRIOR</strong> to placement being made, the Children’s Service Worker shall send the completed ILA 4 Checklist, CD-282 and the Self-Developed Case Plan for Independent Living Arrangement, CD-283 to the Circuit Manager (CM)/Program Manager (PM) for review.</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>After reviewing, the CM/PM will indicate whether the placement constitutes an ILA per the criteria in the Child Welfare Policy Manual. A decision as to whether the placement meets ILA criteria should be determined within 30 days after the checklist is initially received.&nbsp;</li><li>If the placement does not meet the criteria for an ILA, and the family support team or court wishes to pursue the living arrangement, a different placement code will need to be used (i.e. RHU, CTO, etc.).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>A copy of the Independent Living Arrangement (ILA) Checklist, CD-282, the <a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/k4zh5m0zzjdvwevjlhh7gusur13yl5au\">CS-TLP-1</a>, and the Self-Developed Case Plan for Independent Living Arrangement, CD-283 shall be placed in the youth’s file in the Older Youth Program section and a copy shall be provided to the <a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/ioo55ms4an0764tb0eg6bupcxkwj3jnq\">Regional Older Youth Transition Specialists</a> upon completion.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</li><li>Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.&nbsp;</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and directed to:</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PDS CONTACT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sally A.

All foster, relative and kinship providers, both initially and at renewal, should have fingerprints taken by the local office or contracted provider following the process outlined in Memorandum CD04-05. These should then be submitted to BSIU for completion by the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).&nbsp;</p><p>No foster, relative or kinship provider should be sent to the Highway Patrol for fingerprinting except in extreme emergencies and with Regional Director approval. The following is the procedure when sending foster, relative and kinship providers to the Highway Patrol.&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Regional Director gives approval for foster, relative or kinship provider to go to MSHP&nbsp;</li><li>The licensing worker contacts BSIU at 573-751-3448 to make arrangements for foster, relative or kinship provider to go to MSHP.&nbsp;</li><li>The licensing worker will need to provide the following information at the time arrangements are made:&nbsp;<ol><li>Date of birth on each person to be fingerprinted&nbsp;</li><li>Social Security number on each person to be fingerprinted&nbsp;</li><li>Date each person plans to be at MSHP for fingerprinting&nbsp;</li><li>Copy of Regional Director’s Approval</li></ol></li><li>The foster, relative or kinship provider will need to bring the rejected fingerprint card with them if they are being sent to MSHP due to the return of the cards (due to bad prints, unreadable prints, etc).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Foster, relative and kinship providers should not be sent to MSHP except in extreme emergencies and without prior arrangements being made. This procedure was developed due to many concerns that arise when prospective providers are sent without prior notification and approval. First, the families will be charged to have their fingerprint checks completed. The cost is $14 for the MSHP screening and $24 for FBI screening and this cost can not be reimbursed by the Division. Secondly, staff at MSHP must handle any walk-in requests immediately and this takes them away from fingerprint cards that were sent in for processing and creates further delays for other prospective homes. It also creates issues for chain of evidence since the results will be given directly to the prospective providers and will not be processed through BSIU. This also means that our tracking and statistics will not be accurate which can affect funding and create other issues with the legislature and our consumers. By following all procedures for completing fingerprint background screens, we can limit the problems experienced by staff and families. It is the goal of the Division and the Missouri State Highway Patrol to streamline this process and decrease the turnaround time for results. However, this can not be done without the cooperation of all staff, contracted providers and families.&nbsp;</p><p>Additional fingerprinting cards can be ordered through the warehouse. They are form #FD-258. Additional information regarding ordering fingerprinting cards can be obtained by reviewing Memorandum CD04-05.&nbsp;</p><p>NECESSARY ACTION:&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</li><li>Review Memorandum CD04-05.&nbsp;</li><li>The following sections have been changed in the Child Welfare Manual Intranet site:<ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:none;\" type=\"none\"><li>Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment A, Guide for Conducting Foster/Kinship Family Assessments&nbsp;</li><li>Section 6, Chapter 3, Attachment D, Guide for Conducting Renewal Assessment&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>All comments and questions regarding this memorandum should be cleared through normal supervisory channels.</li></ol><p>FMS/SW:js</p>\n  </div>"

Missouri’s Children’s Division is responsible for assuring the highest degree of safety possible for children entering the state. According to the Child Welfare Manual, Section 6.3.A, the following steps are to be taken when completing a background investigation in a home assessment for the purpose of licensure. The <strong>same steps</strong> are to be taken in completion of any ICPC assessment.</p><h4><br>STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED FOR LICENSURE:</h4><p>The following steps shall be completed for every applicant and adult household member<br>(age 18 and older).<strong> Supporting documentation of each step is to be filed in the</strong><br><strong>licensing record</strong>.</p><ol><li>The Child Abuse/Neglect background screening will continue to be done by the<br>local Children’s Division (CD).</li><li>Each household member 18 years of age and older must register with the Family<br>Care Safety Registry (FCSR).

Each caller will know how the call was classified and what action will be taken.</p><p>The SDM process plays a significant role in the new CANHU Protocol. &nbsp;Specifically, three SDM screening and classification functions have been built into CANHU Protocol questions. &nbsp;They include:&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><strong>CA/N Screen-In Criteria</strong> – These questions address criteria concerning whether a call is classified as a child abuse and neglect report for investigation or family assessment, a referral or a documented call (DOC). &nbsp;If screened-in, the call is accepted as a CA/N report or a referral and is sent to the county office. &nbsp;If the report is screened out, the call is documented and entered into the database, but no further action is taken. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>SDM Response Priority </strong>– Criteria to determine the time frame in which the family should be contacted is also built in the CANHU Protocol. &nbsp;There are three response levels. &nbsp;These levels take the place of the “Emergency Contact” field in the CA/N automated system. &nbsp; However, current policy regarding initial contact with the children in the home remains in effect.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><em><strong>Note: &nbsp;Missouri statutes have not changed and all calls are to be initiated in 24 hours. (RSMo 210.145.4) &nbsp;For investigations, child(ren) must be seen within 3 hour for emergency situations and initiated within 24 hours for non-emergency cases. &nbsp;For CA/N reports when the only allegation is educational neglect, victims must be seen within 72 hours. &nbsp;For Family Assessments, all children in the household must be seen within 72 hours and contact must be initiated within 24 hours, unless the situation is an emergency.</strong></em></p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li><strong>Level 1 (3 hours) </strong>– This is equivalent to an emergency report. &nbsp;Face-to-face contact with all victim(s) listed on the CA/N-1 must be made within three hours from the receipt of the report. &nbsp;A face-to-face contact with all other children living in the household must be made within 72 hours. &nbsp;Available resources shall be utilized to locate the children, including law enforcement assistance;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Level 2 (24 hours) </strong>– Face-to-face contact with all victim(s) listed on the CA/N-1 must be made within 24 hours from receipt of the report. &nbsp;A face-to-face contact with other children residing in the home must occur within 72 hours;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Note: &nbsp;Investigations and family assessments with a level 2 response require a face-toface contact with the child(ren) victim(s) and must be initiated within 24 hours.&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li><strong>Level 3 (72 hours) </strong>– Face-to-face contact with all children (victims and home residents) must be made within 72 hours from receipt of the report. &nbsp;Initial contact for Investigations must be within 24 hours.</li></ul><p>Note: &nbsp;Face-to-face contact can be made by members of the multidisciplinary team (mandated reporters such as juvenile officer, or law enforcement personnel). &nbsp;Initial contacts can include phone calls or contact with appropriate persons in an attempt to make a home visit.</p><p><strong>CANHU Protocol Cards Testing:</strong> CANHU Protocol Cards are in a testing phase presently and printed on tabbed flip cards that are easily navigated, however this process will eventually be part of the automated CA/N system. &nbsp;During this testing period, half of each shift of CANHU staff will practice this process, while the other half will serve as the control group by utilizing the old procedure. &nbsp;Following the conclusion of the experiment all CANHU staff will use the protocol process.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Response Priority Testing:&nbsp;</strong> Also during a testing phase of development, reports will initially be coming to the local division office with either “Response Priority One, Two or Three” or “emergency or non- emergency”. &nbsp; This is for the purpose of comparison. &nbsp;The worker should treat them as they come in and document on the CPS-1 whether there is a Priority Response Level or it is an emergency or non-emergency status. &nbsp;</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\" start=\"3\"><li><strong>SDM Track Assignment Guidelines</strong> – Also built into the CANHU Protocol are criteria designed to determine if the screened-in report is an investigation (I) or an assessment (A). &nbsp;Track Assignment will now be completed at CANHU prior to being sent to the local division office and displayed in the CA/N automated system and on the CA/N-1 form printed through the automated system. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>Track Assignment Testing:&nbsp;</strong> <em>During this experimental period all CANHU staff will assign track.</em> Field staff will need to review reports as they come in to assess whether the appropriate track has been assigned or whether additional information received warrants a track change.&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:none;\" type=\"none\"><li>&nbsp; The decision to change the track assignment must be reviewed and approved by the worker’s supervisor. &nbsp; The CS-27, “Child Abuse/Neglect Screening Form”, formally used by the field to determine track assignment, is now called “CPS Classification Reassignment Update Screen” and will now be used for track changes. &nbsp;If the track change is approved, the change in track assignment must be entered into the CA/N automated system using the ATRU transaction. &nbsp;Field staff should continue to record the worker and supervisor ID in the CA/N automated system using the ATRU transaction at the time the report is received in the county office. &nbsp; &nbsp;Central office staff will monitor these track changes in an effort to maintain consistency and accuracy of appropriate track assignment as well as analyze and identify trends county and statewide where the track assignment has been updated. &nbsp;(See attached examples of revised CA/N System screens: AI25, ATRI, ATRU, AUPD, and CAN1.)&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>INVESTIGATIONS/FAMILY ASSESSMENT RESPONSE TOOLS&nbsp;</h4><p><em><strong>Child Protection Services Response Tool (CPS-1) and the Safety Assessment (Part B) CPS-1A</strong></em>: &nbsp;In conjunction with the introduction of SDM to the investigation/family assessment process comes the new <em>Child Protection Services Response Tool (CPS-1</em>) and the <em>Safety Assessment (Part B) CPS-1A.</em> &nbsp;The CPS-1 and the CPS-1A will be used when responding to Child Abuse/Neglect (CA/N) reports. &nbsp;The CPS-1 and CPS-1A will replace the CA/N-4 for Investigations and the current CS-16 for Family Assessments. A revised form of the CS-16 will continue to be used for Family-Centered Services (FCS) and Family-Centered Out-of Home Care (FCOOHC) cases.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Safety Assessment:</strong></em> &nbsp;The first part of the SDM safety assessment is located on the second page of the CPS-1 and Part B is on the CPS-1A. &nbsp;The purpose of the safety assessment is to help determine whether any child is in <em>immediate danger of serious physical harm,</em> &nbsp;who may require a protective intervention and to determine what interventions should be maintained or initiated to provide appropriate protection. &nbsp;Safety of the child(ren) in the home shall be an on-going concern during the investigation and family assessment.&nbsp;</p><p>The safety assessment replaces the CS-15 Safety Factor Determination for investigations and page 3 in the CS-16. &nbsp;The CPS-1 Safety Assessment and the CPS1A is to be completed for all investigations and family assessments during or immediately following the initial visit with a family in response to a child abuse/neglect report. &nbsp;The Safety Assessment is used to guide decisions on whether or not the child(ren) may remain in the home, or if the child(ren) must be protectively placed. &nbsp;The Safety is also used prior to a child returning home after being placed in Family-Centered Out-of-Home Care (FCOOHC).&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong></em> &nbsp;The SDM Risk Assessment is designed to identify families, which have low, moderate, high, or very high probabilities of future abuse or neglect. &nbsp;By completing the risk assessment, the worker obtains an objective appraisal of the likelihood that a family will maltreat their children in the next 18 to 24 months. &nbsp;The difference between risk levels is substantial. &nbsp;High risk families have significantly higher rates of subsequent referral and substantiation than low risk families, and are more often involved in serious abuse or neglect incidents. &nbsp;When risk is clearly defined and objectively quantified the agency can ensure that resources are targeted to higher risk families because of the greater potential to reduce subsequent maltreatment.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Note: The risk assessment in used only when there are children in the home. &nbsp;If children are removed from the home during the investigation/family assessment or from an on going FCS case, the use of the SDM safety and risk tools are suspended, unless at least one child remains in the home, or until the children are returned.&nbsp;</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Safety Reassessment (CS-16D):</strong> &nbsp;The Safety Reassessment (CS-16D) is a critical follow up piece to the Safety Assessment. &nbsp;The Safety Reassessment enables the worker to assess child safety, determine if previously identified factors have been resolved, or if safety factors have increased. &nbsp;A Safety Reassessment is required whenever a child(ren) is removed during the investigation/family assessment. &nbsp;The reassessment is then completed to guide decision making on return of the child(ren). &nbsp;A child must be safe or conditionally safe prior to returning home. The CD Worker will complete the safety reassessment tool:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Prior to a child(ren) returning to the home following out-of-home placement during the investigation/family assessment period.&nbsp;</li><li>At the expiration of the initial safety plan.&nbsp;</li><li>On any case whenever new information becomes available that indicates a threat to the safety of the child(ren).&nbsp;</li></ul><p><em><strong>Risk Reassessment (CS-16E): &nbsp;</strong></em>The Risk Reassessment (CS-16 E) assesses risk of future child maltreatment and assists workers in evaluating whether risk levels have decreased, remained the same or have increased since the initial risk assessment.&nbsp;</p><p>The Risk Assessment is to be completed at the conclusion of every investigation/family assessment in which there are children who remain in the home. &nbsp; The risk assessment identifies the level of risk of future maltreatment and is used to guide the decision to close or open the investigation/family assessment for ongoing services. &nbsp;The following chart shows the recommended case open/close decisions based on the risk level for investigations and family assessments:&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Risk-Based Case Open/Close Guidelines</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Risk Level</td><td colspan=\"2\">Investigations&nbsp;</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Family Assessments&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Probable Cause</td><td>Unsubstantiated</td></tr><tr><td>Low&nbsp;</td><td>Close&nbsp;</td><td>Close&nbsp;</td><td>Close&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Moderate&nbsp;</td><td>Open/Close&nbsp;</td><td>Close&nbsp;</td><td>Open/Close&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>Open&nbsp;</td><td>Open/Close w/referral&nbsp;</td><td>Open/Close w/referral&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Very High</td><td>Open&nbsp;</td><td>Open/Close w/referral&nbsp;</td><td>Open/Close w/referral&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Note: &nbsp;There may be unique circumstances in which it is appropriate to open low risk cases (for example, court-ordered services), or close very high risk cases (for example, family moved out of state). &nbsp;Reasons for opening or closing cases outside of the recommended guidelines should be clearly documented in the case record.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Priority of Initial Client Contact after a Case Opening Based on SDM Risk</strong>: Prior to signing off on a CA/N investigation/family assessment, the Supervisor will review the CPS-1and will determine the priority of the initial face to face interview with the family based on the following SDM risk levels:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:none;\" type=\"none\"><li>• High or Very High Risk - within one (1) working day; &nbsp;</li><li>• Moderate Risk - within five (5) working days; and&nbsp;</li><li>• Low Risk - within ten (10) working days. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>If the case referral was not due to a CA/N investigation/family assessment, the supervisor's appraisal of the potential risk to the children and overall family situation will determine when treatment follow-up contact by the Family-Centered Services (FCS) worker is needed. <strong>THIS SHOULD NOT EXCEED TEN (10) WORKING DAYS FROM CASE ASSIGNMENT.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Revised CS-16: &nbsp;</strong>Although we saw great value in the comprehensive approach that the original CS-16 provided when conducting a family assessment, such as the genogram, ecomap, pattern of behavior and timeline, these tools more appropriately fit into the treatment phase of family intervention. The purpose of this revision was to streamline the CS-16 to better fit the treatment process and to exclude parts of the form applicable only in a Family Assessment. &nbsp;The result was a less lengthy, more user friendly CS-16 that contains the essential pieces of a thorough family-centered assessment with the added structure and standardization that the SDM safety and risk assessments provide.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Family Contact Guidelines for In-Home Cases:</strong> &nbsp;The Family Risk Assessment provides reliable, valid information on the risk to children of future abuse and neglect. &nbsp;Appropriate use of this assessment data is key to ensuring better protection of children. &nbsp;Therefore, for cases that have been opened for ongoing FCS services or for FCOOHC cases in which there are children who remain in the home, the risk level is used to guide the minimum amount of contact with the family each month. &nbsp;These guidelines are considered \"best practice\" and help focus staff resources on the highest risk cases. &nbsp;They dictate the minimum number of face-to-face and collateral contacts with the family each month, however workers will use their best judgment for individual cases to best determine whether more contacts are needed. &nbsp;</p><p>The definition and purpose of a face-to-face “contact” is: to monitor developments in the case, to observe interaction between the caregiver and the child(ren), to facilitate implementation of the Case Plan, and to assess progress with the plan or possible revision to the plan. &nbsp;It is used to guide monthly contacts while the case is open, and is reviewed at each risk reassessment until the case is closed.&nbsp;</p><p>The risk level determines the overall minimum contact standards for the family. &nbsp;The “Children’s Division Minimum Contact Standards” represent how many of the overall contact standards must be met by the CD worker. &nbsp;The remaining contacts may be met by a contracted in-home service provider who is working with the family as part of the family’s case plan. &nbsp;However, if the contracted service provider was unable to complete monthly contacts, the CD worker is responsible for meeting the overall contact standards. &nbsp;</p><p>The CD worker is responsible for making all collateral contacts. &nbsp;Collateral contacts include phone contact with school personnel and day care providers, medical personnel who have recently seen or treated the child(ren), parenting class instructors, etc. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Minimum Contact Guidelines for In-Home Family Cases” refers to FCS Cases or for FCOOHC cases where children are in the home and represents the recommended number of contacts that workers should have with families according to their assessed risk level.(likelihood of future maltreatment): &nbsp;(For FCOOHC cases, where there are no children in the home refer to Child Welfare Manual Section 4.7.3.1: Meeting and Working with the

class=\"s1\"> </span>(BFC) and Career Programs.<span class=\"s2\"> </span>The changes come as a result of a workgroup composed<span class=\"s3\"> </span>of staff from each of the regions, Regional Directors, resource providers, and staff from<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Central Office.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>The goal of the group was to develop a program to improve child stability<span class=\"s1\"> </span>and well-being, enhance current policy, and standardize the BFC and Career programs<span class=\"s3\"> </span>statewide.<span class=\"s4\"> </span>The<span class=\"s5\"> </span>recommendations<span class=\"s6\"> </span>from<span class=\"s5\"> </span>the<span class=\"s5\"> </span>workgroup<span class=\"s6\"> </span>resulted<span class=\"s5\"> </span>in<span class=\"s6\"> </span>the<span class=\"s7\"> </span>following<span class=\"s8\"> </span>changes:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>An Improved</strong><span class=\"s5\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Title</strong></p><p class=\"p3\">Foster Care for Youth with Elevated Needs is a program designed for the youth with<span class=\"s3\"> </span>identifiable and documented moderate or serious emotional and/or behavioral needs.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>The new name more accurately captures the needs of the child instead of focusing on<span class=\"s3\"> </span>the negative behaviors.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Youth with Elevated Needs-Level A will be the new name for<span class=\"s3\"> </span>the BFC program and Youth with Elevated Needs-Level B will be the new name for the<span class=\"s1\"> </span>Career program.</p><p class=\"p6\"><strong>Screening</strong><span class=\"s5\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>and</strong><span class=\"s5\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Assessment</strong><span class=\"s5\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>of</strong><span class=\"s5\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Need</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">This memorandum also introduces the Youth with Elevated Needs Referral Checklist,<span class=\"s3\"> </span>CD-136, Youth with Elevated Needs Referral Form, CD-137, and Youth with Elevated<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Needs Six Month Review Form, CD-138, which will be used statewide in an effort to<span class=\"s3\"> </span>provide more consistency across the regions.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>At the time of the initial referral, the<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Children’s<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Service<span class=\"s5\"> </span>Worker<span class=\"s3\"> </span>will<span class=\"s3\"> </span>complete<span class=\"s3\"> </span>the<span class=\"s5\"> </span>Referral Checklist and<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Referral Form with<span class=\"s3\"> </span>the<span class=\"s6\"> </span>required<span class=\"s5\"> </span>attachments<span class=\"s5\"> </span>and<span class=\"s5\"> </span>submit<span class=\"s5\"> </span>to<span class=\"s5\"> </span>their<span class=\"s5\"> </span>supervisor<span class=\"s5\"> </span>for<span class=\"s5\"> </span>approval.<span class=\"s2\"> </span>The<span class=\"s5\"> </span>referral<span class=\"s5\"> </span>packet<span class=\"s9\"> </span>will then be presented at the staffing.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>The Six Month Review Form will be completed<span class=\"s3\"> </span>during<span class=\"s8\"> </span>the<span class=\"s3\"> </span>six<span class=\"s3\"> </span>month<span class=\"s3\"> </span>staffing<span class=\"s8\"> </span>to<span class=\"s3\"> </span>determine<span class=\"s3\"> </span>whether<span class=\"s8\"> </span>the<span class=\"s8\"> </span>child<span class=\"s10\"> </span>continues<span class=\"s3\"> </span>to<span class=\"s3\"> </span>meet<span class=\"s8\"> </span>the<span class=\"s3\"> </span>criteria<span class=\"s5\"> </span>for<span class=\"s6\"> </span>the Youth with Elevated Needs<span class=\"s5\"> </span>program.</p><p class=\"p7\"><strong>In addition, this memorandum eliminates the use of the Residential Treatment</strong><span class=\"s3\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Referral Form, CS-9, as a part of the Youth with Elevated Needs referral packet.</strong><span class=\"s3\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Staff will no longer be required to complete the CS-9 when making a referral for a</strong><span class=\"s1\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>youth</strong><span class=\"s5\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>with elevated needs.</strong></p><p class=\"p6\"><strong>Staffing</strong><span class=\"s5\"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Participants</strong></p><p class=\"p3\">The policy change requires the case manager, supervisor, and designated facilitator<span class=\"s3\"> </span>(circuit/regional specialist or consultant) to attend the staffing.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>The designated facilitator<span class=\"s1\"> </span>is responsible for ensuring that youth staffed for the Youth with Elevated Needs program<span class=\"s1\"> </span>truly meet the criteria for the program and ensuring that youth are placed in the least<span class=\"s3\"> </span>restrictive environment as their needs decrease.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>The list of attendees who should be<span class=\"s3\"> </span>invited to the staffing was also modified and changed accordingly in the manual.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Those<span class=\"s3\"> </span>who are unable to attend the staffing should be encouraged to submit their input prior to<span class=\"s3\"> </span>the<span class=\"s5\"> </span>staffing for<span class=\"s5\"> </span>consideration.</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Competencies</strong></p><p class=\"p3\">Because some knowledge and skills are essential before children are placed with<span class=\"s3\"> </span>families, competencies were developed for resource providers of youth with elevated<span class=\"s3\"> </span>needs.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>Competencies take into account the knowledge of the resource provider and<span class=\"s3\"> </span>their ability to perform the necessary skills to successfully parent a youth with elevated<span class=\"s3\"> </span>needs.<span class=\"s3\"> </span>The following competencies will assist resource workers in assessing the needs<span class=\"s1\"> </span>of<span class=\"s3\"> </span>the<span class=\"s5\"> </span>resource<span class=\"s5\"> </span>providers<span class=\"s3\"> </span>and<span class=\"s5\"> </span>identifying services<span class=\"s5\"> </span>to achieve<span class=\"s5\">

</span>Any provider receiving the Professional Parenting payment must complete the required in-service training hours, including relative and kinship care providers.<span class=\"s2\"> </span>If a foster parent does not receive the required number of hours of training during the licensing period, the professional parent payment may be suspended by closing the Professional Parent contract (CM-14).<span class=\"s2\"> </span>A Cooperative Agreement for the Purchase of Foster Care Services (CM-3) may need to be opened for maintenance payments to continue.<span class=\"s2\"> </span>Staff should contact the Contract Management unit in Central Office to close a CM-14 or open a CM- 3 contract.<span class=\"s2\"> </span>They can be reached at 573-526-0954.</p><p class=\"p1\">A plan must be developed between the foster parent and the Division to make up the necessary training hours.<span class=\"s2\"> </span>These hours <span class=\"s4\">will not count toward the next licensing period</span>, only toward the previous licensing period.<span class=\"s2\"> </span>The foster parent would still be responsible for obtaining the required hours for the next licensing period.<span

career) of in-service training for each licensing period.</p><p class=\"p5\">Once the foster parent obtains the needed hours of training, the professional parent contract<span class=\"s3\">

Adoption Resource Services, Technical Assistance, and Consultation contract, FCARSTC, replaces the Foster Care and Adoption Resource Services contract, FCARS, and the Specialized Foster Care Training services (Career and Behavioral) contract. &nbsp;</p><p>The Child Welfare Manual has been updated to include the training requirements for those resource providers serving children with elevated behavioral and emotional needs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A result of the new contract is policy regarding frequency of STARS training. &nbsp;Previous policy stated that STARS sessions are limited to one a

regarding the requirements of relative care providers seeking to adopt children in Division custody. &nbsp;The policy change is included in the Child Welfare Manual, Section 6, Chapter 2, Attachment B, Pre-Service and In-Service Training; STARS Competencies. &nbsp;</p><p>Current policy states that those wanting to adopt must complete the 12 hours of “STARS, Making the Commitment to Adoption” Pre-Service training, also known as Spaulding. &nbsp;Effective with the date of this memorandum, relative care providers are no longer required to complete Spaulding training in order to adopt the relative child placed in their home. &nbsp;Foster and kinship care providers are still required to complete this training prior to adoption. &nbsp;The Children’s Division strongly recommends that relatives complete the training as it provides prospective adoptive parents with tools and knowledge to assist in helping the child transition from alternative care to adoption as well as with information on some of the challenges to adopting a child in Division custody. &nbsp;However, due to the family bond and prior relationship between the provider and foster child, it is no longer mandatory for relative providers to attend this training. &nbsp;Relative providers are still required to complete the “STARS for the Caregiver Who Knows the Child” training. &nbsp;</p><p>As discussed in memorandum <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/memos/2006/37/cd0637.pdf\">CD06-37</a> relating to Resource Provider Training, the 27 hours of STARS pre-service training can not be counted toward a provider’s required in-service training hours. &nbsp;However, Spaulding training may be counted toward those hours as not all providers complete this training prior to licensure and it is not required for licensure as a foster, relative or kinship care provider.</p><table style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255,

If there are smokers in the resource home, the plan to protect foster youth from secondhand smoke exposure is to be included in the Home Assessment. A PowerPoint, Protecting Foster Youth from Secondhand Smoke Exposure, is to be viewed by all resource parents prior to licensure or approval to provide foster care services.</p><p>There are currently eighteen states that require foster homes to be smoke free through <a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/4svvlo4wu4dnu3xua9d1plxp67nrk1qn\">legislation and policy</a>.</p><p>The following conditions have been linked to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150220011007/https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Dangers-of-Secondhand-Smoke.aspx\">secondhand smoke exposure in children</a>:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>SIDS&nbsp;</li><li>More respiratory infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia&nbsp;</li><li>More severe and frequent asthma attacks&nbsp;</li><li>Ear infections&nbsp;</li><li>Chronic cough&nbsp;</li><li>Tooth decay&nbsp;</li><li>Long term effects including&nbsp;<ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:circle;\" type=\"circle\"><li>Poor lung development&nbsp;</li><li>Lung cancer&nbsp;</li><li>Heart disease&nbsp;</li><li>Cataracts</li></ul></li></ul><p>Missouri law tasks the Children’s Division with placing youth in the division’s care and custody, in homes that safeguard and promote their present and continuing good health and in homes that will not commit any act or engage in any conduct that would be injurious to the child’s health.</p><p>A new training to educate resource providers about exposure to secondhand smoke is now required. The PowerPoint presentation, Protecting Foster Youth from Secondhand Smoke Exposure is self-taught and is located on the Children’s Division’s <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/fostercare/fpinfo2.htm\">Foster Parent Information</a> Internet page. All new resource applicants for providing foster care services must complete the training prior to licensure or approval. Currently licensed and approved resource providers may complete the training and receive a one hour inservice training credit using code V113, Secondhand Smoke Exposure.</p><p>The Notification of Hazards (CD-101) has been revised to include a checkbox to indicate which household members are smokers. Currently licensed and approved resource providers who smoke or have any individual living in the home who smokes will need to complete the CD-101 at time of renewal.</p><p>If any household member is a smoker, the plan to protect foster youth from secondhand smoke exposure is to be discussed. Refer the family to the required pre-service video, Protecting Foster Youth from Secondhand Smoke Exposure. Discuss with the resource parent(s) their plan to talk to foster youth about smoking and about the resource parent(s)’ role model of making healthy choices. This information as well as a plan to protect foster youth from secondhand smoke exposure is captured in the Health Status section of the Home Assessment.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION</strong>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</li><li>Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.&nbsp;</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and directed to:</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PDS CONTACT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Elizabeth Tattershall&nbsp;</p><p>573-522-1191&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov\">Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td><p><strong>PROGRAM MANAGER</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Amy Martin&nbsp;</p><p>573-751-3171&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Amy.L.Martin@dss.mo.gov\">Amy.L.Martin@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section4/ch17/sec4ch17sub3.htm\">Respite Care Recruitment and Retention 4.17.3</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section4/ch17/sec4ch17sub9.htm\">Respite Care Case Recording 4.17.9</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section5/ch1/sec5ch1sub6.htm#n161\">Recording Guidelines and Record Composition- Resource Provider Records, 5.1.6.1</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2sub2.htm\">Resource Provider Training, Working With Prospective Foster/Adoptive Parents, 6.2.2</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch3/sec6ch3attacha.htm\">Guide for Conducting Resource Provider Family Assessments, 6.3.A</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch3/sec6ch3attachc.htm\">Resource Provider Family Assessment Recording Outline, 6.3.C</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch3/sec6ch3sub5.htm\">Conducting Resource Home Renewal, 6.3.5</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch13/sec6ch13sub1.htm\">Resource Development Worker Responsibilities, 6.13.1</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240309130534/https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/forms/\">Notification of Hazards, CD-101</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>REFERENCE DOCUMENTS AND RESOURCES</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Protecting Foster Youth from Secondhand Smoke Exposure&nbsp;</p><p>Dangers of Children Exposed to Secondhand Smoke <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240212084403/https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Dangers-of-Secondhand-Smoke.aspx\">https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthissues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Dangers-of-Secondhand-Smoke.aspx&nbsp;</a></p><p>Tobacco Fact Sheet, <a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/gu0mr6duytn5gj1fgcy1gr9a0u4rc5jg\">http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2010/pdfs/keyfindings.pdf</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Surgeon General’s Report <a href=\"https://www.njgasp.org/chronic-disease-diabetes-tobacco/surgeon-general-reports/2014-u-s-surgeon-general-report/\">http://www.njgasp.org/chronic-disease-diabetestobacco/surgeon-general-reports/2014-u-s-surgeon-general-report/</a>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Secondhand smoke</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lung.org/associations/states/nevada/local-offices/vegas/assets/pdfs/secondhand-smoke-fact-sheet.pdf\">http://www.lung.org/associations/states/nevada/localoffices/vegas/assets/pdfs/secondhand-smoke-fact-sheet.pdf</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>RELATED STATUTE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>210.109.

The HIPAA Privacy Rule is a federal rule designed to protect individuals’ medical records and other personal health information.</p><p>In the course of business, the Children’s Division (CD) receives, discloses and utilizes Protected Health Information of employees and clients for a variety of reasons. Employees should exercise care at all times to discuss confidential, sensitive, or personal health information in a manner or place where the discussion is not able to be easily overheard. Measures should be taken to ensure that health information is not accessible to anyone other than the authorized personnel. CD staff will maintain privacy, confidentiality and integrity with regard to protected health information as<br>required by state and federal laws, rules and regulations and professional ethics. Employees found to be in violation of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal as well as prosecution in a court of law.</p><p>Required HIPAA documents are located on Children’s Division E-forms. The informational PowerPoint and Video presented by Children’s Division Privacy Officers in 2003 is located in Training Resources on CD Intranet page.</p><p>The requirement to provide the two HIPAA documents, Notice of Privacy Practices Regarding your Protected Health Information, MO866-4061 and Resource Provider Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Information,CD-194, has been added to the list of documents to provide to resource parents to the list of documents provided to<br>resource provider applicants during the assessment process and at licensure renewal.</p><p>The CD-194 is read and signed at each re-licensure. One (1) hour of in-service training<br>credit is earned only for the initial time.</p><table style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0px;color:rgb(21, 21, 21);display:table;font-family:var(--serif);font-size:1.2rem;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:1.15;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;max-width:100%;orphans:2;overflow-x:auto;padding:0px;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;width:930px;word-spacing:0px;\"><tbody style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><tr style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><td style=\"font-size:1rem;margin:0px;padding:10px;\" colspan=\"2\"><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\">NECESSARY ACTION</strong></p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.</li><li>Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and directed to:</li></ol></td></tr><tr style=\"background-color:rgb(243, 243, 243);margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><td style=\"font-size:1rem;margin:0px;padding:10px;\"><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\">PDS CONTACT</strong><br>Elizabeth Tattershall<br>573-522-1191</p><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov\">Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td style=\"font-size:1rem;margin:0px;padding:10px;\"><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\">PROGRAM MANAGER</strong><br>Marta Halter &nbsp;</p><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\">573-751-2427&nbsp;</p><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov\">Marta.Halter@dss.mo.gov</a><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\"> &nbsp;</strong></p></td></tr><tr style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\"><td style=\"font-size:1rem;margin:0px;padding:10px;\" colspan=\"2\"><p style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1.8;margin:0px 0px 1.5em;padding:0px;\"><strong style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\">CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section5/ch2/sec5ch2sub7.htm\">Record Access, Health Information Portability and Accountability Act</a><br><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2sub2.htm\">Resource Provider Training-STARS, Working with Prospective Foster/Adoptive Parents</a><br><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2sub5.htm\">Resource Provider Training-STARS, In-Service</a><br><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch3/sec6ch3attacha.htm\">Resource Family Assessment &amp;

There are several sections of the Child Welfare Manual that a resource licensing worker must use and follow when opening and developing a resource provider case file during the initial licensure/assessment process:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:square;\" type=\"square\"><li>Recording Guidelines, 5.1.6</li><li>Record Access Out-of-Home Care Provider Records, 5.2.6</li><li>Resource Provider Training – STARS, 6.2</li><li>Resource Family Assessment and Licensing Process Foster/ Kinship<br>Assessment, 6.3.1</li><li>Guide for Conducting Foster/ Kinship Assessments, 6.3 attachment A</li><li>Foster/Kinship Family Assessment Recording Outline, 6.3 Attachment C</li><li>Children's Service Worker Responsibilities, 6.3 attachment M</li></ul><p>The <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section5/ch1/sec5ch1sub6.htm\">Recording Guidelines and Record Composition </a>section of the Child Welfare Manual identifies all the documents that are required to be present in the resource provider case file. Resource provider case files are available to the public under Missouri's Sunshine Law, Chapter 610, RSMo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Results of a File Review</h4><p><br>A recent review of resource provider case files identified trends of information and documents contained in a resource provider's case file contrary to policy. Staff must be diligent to adhere to the policy guidelines. The following are some of the identified trends:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:square;\" type=\"square\"><li><p>Use current revision of agency forms</p><p>Forms are updated frequently for format issues and revised in response to<br>Continuous Quality Improvement requests and legislative changes. Always check E-<br>forms and Desk Top forms for the most current version of forms. This ensures that the<br>most recent requirement for requested information is obtained.</p></li><li>Only place documents in the file which are required in policy for that<br>section.<br>No documents shall be placed in the case file that are not specified in policy as a requirement for licensure, maintaining of licensure, and licensure renewal. Some<br>documents may be obtained or viewed in order to complete the home<br>assessment but should not be maintained in the record. Items that should not be<br>in the case file, except in adverse action cases as outlined later in this<br>memorandum, include, but are not limited to, the following items which were<br>observed in the case file review:</li><li>Directions to the home, including MapQuest print outs.</li><li>Copies of Social Security cards, birth certificates, school diplomas, car titles,<br>driver's licenses, and STARS/Spaulding homework.</li><li>Bank account numbers, bank account statements, tax filing forms. The Financial<br>Worksheet provided in the STARS curriculum Step 6 is the worksheet to be used<br>to determine stable finances and money management. However, the worksheet<br>is a part of the STARS homework and is not to be kept in the file.</li><li>Child-specific information including court orders and the Child Assessment and<br>Service Plan, CS-1</li><li>Outdated Vendor Licensure/Placement Resource Form, SS-60</li><li>Outdated fingerprint results</li></ul><p>There are many documents that may be viewed by the resource licensing worker in completing the assessment and reassessment; however, only the documents found in the <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section5/ch1/sec5ch1sub6.htm\">Recording Guidelines and Composition </a>section of the manual should be placed in the file.</p><h4>Denial and Revocation</h4><p><br>If during the licensure or re licensure process it is determined that the award of a foster care license is to be denied or revoked, <strong>all supporting documentation for the adverse action shall be retained for utilization during the fair hearing process</strong> should the resource provider grieve the decision including those documents outlined in this memorandum to be removed. This documentation shall be placed in the Administrative section of the resource provider case record. The decision to deny or revoke a foster care license must be based on non-compliance and or incompetency’s with statute and licensing rules.</p><h4>Training Section</h4><p>Upon approving and entering the license in the system, CD staff are to return all the<br>homework pages that were completed to fulfill the STARS/Spaulding pre-service training<br>requirements to the resource provider. There will be one training section in the file<br>labeled “Training Section”. Documents that are to be placed in the Training Section<br>include:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:square;\" type=\"square\"><li>All training certificates</li><li>All training sign-sheets</li><li>Training Record Screens</li><li>Resource Family In-Service Training Request, CD-114</li><li>All flyers and notifications of in-service training opportunities</li></ul><p>It is imperative to include all the above listed documents in the training section in order to<br>verify notification of available trainings and actual training hours earned by the resource<br>provider.</p><h4>Additional Clarifications</h4><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:square;\" type=\"square\"><li>The Weapon Statement Agreement is obsolete. The language that referred to<br>such a form has been removed from the manual. Weapon storage and safety is<br>addressed on the Resource Home and Safety Checklist, CS-45, section C<br>number 15. However, if there is a Weapon Statement Agreement currently in the<br>file, do not remove it. File it in the forms section of the file.</li><li>Language in the manual has been revised for consistency to reflect that the<br>Professional Family Development Plan, CD-100, is to be reviewed quarterly,<br>annually, and at the time of license renewal.</li><li>Council on Accreditation requires that the resource provider home have a plan of<br>action in the case of an emergency and/or disaster. There is to be a section in<br>the resource provider case file under a red cover sheet titled Emergency/Disaster<br>Plan. Content for this section is outlined in memo <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/memos/2006/33/cd0633.pdf\">CD06-33</a>.</li><li>An additional background check requirement for resource provider applicants is<br>the Alternative Care Vendor Licensure History Inquiry, ZVLH, screen and Kinship<br>Licensure Type History Inquiry, ZVKH, screen. Checking these screens will<br>determine if the resource provider has applied for and/or were issued foster care<br>license(s) in Missouri in the past.</li><li>When doing the background checks, it is imperative to place in the file the print<br>out pages for <a href=\"https://www.courts.mo.gov/cnet/welcome.do\">case.net</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.mshp.dps.mo.gov/CJ38/searchRegistry.jsp\">sex offender list by address</a> including those<br>indicating no match was found.</li></ul><h4>Implementation</h4><p>All new resource provider case records shall be opened as outlined in this memorandum. The following steps are to be taken to implement the revision of policy presented in this memorandum for currently open resource provider case records:<br>&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Workers are to take the resource provider case record to a quarterly home visit.</li><li>Workers are to present to the resource provider the policy update regarding the<br>contents of the provider’s file.</li><li>Workers are to review the resource provider’s file with the provider and remove<br>the contents that are not required to be in the file per this memorandum.</li><li>Workers shall return personal documents and copies of personal documents that<br>are removed from the file to the resource provider.</li></ul><p>Compliance with the requirements of resource provider case record contents as discussed in this memorandum shall be completed prior to October 20, 2010.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION</strong></p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.</li><li>Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and<br>directed to:</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PDS CONTACT</strong><br>Elizabeth Tattershall<br>573-522-119</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov\">Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td><p><strong>PROGRAM MANAGER</strong><br>Melody Yancey<br>573-751-313</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Elizabeth.Tattershall@dss.mo.gov\">Melody.Yancey@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS</strong><br><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section5/ch1/sec5ch1sub6.htm\">Documentation and Record Maintenance Recording Guidelines and Record&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170716222910/http://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section5/ch1/sec5ch1sub6.htm\">composition- Resource Provider Records, Section 5 Chapter 1 Subsection 6</a><br><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch3/sec6ch3attachm.htm\">Resource Family Assessment and Licensing Process Children's Service Worker</a><br><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch3/sec6ch3attachm.htm\">Responsibilities, Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment M</a><br><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2sub5.htm\">Resource Provider Training-STARS, Section 6 Chapter 2 Subsection 5</a><br><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2sub2.htm\">Resource Provider Training-STARS, Section 6 Chapter 2 Subsection 2</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br>N/A<br>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>REFERENCE DOCUMENTS AND RESOURCES</strong><br>N/A</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>RELATED STATUTE</strong><br>N/A</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE RULE</strong><br><a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/0ewenrhw7ph4kzkymt4zew87k71xag42\">13 CSR 35-60 Licensing of Foster Family Homes</a></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a href=\"http://dssweb/cs/standards/start.html\"><strong>COUNCIL ON ACCREDITATION (COA) STANDARDS</strong></a><strong> (Employee Access Only)</strong><br>G5.7.01 The organization follows procedures for responding to accidents, serious<br>illness, fire, medical emergencies, water emergencies, natural disasters, and other life<br>threatening situations<br>G5.7.04 All of the organization’s programs prepare to deal effectively with injuries,<br>accidents and illnesses</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES REVIEW (CFSR)</strong><br>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><br><br><br>&nbsp;</li></ul>\n  </div>"

The purpose of the act is to protect children from sexual exploitation, violent crime, prevent child abuse and child pornography, to promote Internet safety, and to honor the memory of Adam Walsh and other child crime victims.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the Act was signed into federal law, the Children’s Division has made changes such as FBI fingerprint checks on Resource homes and checking the Sex Offender Registry to be in compliance with this Act.&nbsp;</p><p>An additional background check is now to be implemented to further comply with the Adam Walsh Act and to ensure the safety of the children placed in the Division’s care and custody. As part of the licensing process, staff will now expand the CA/N background checks on each household member 17 years of age and older to include each state they have resided in since the age of 17.&nbsp;</p><p>The search can be conducted by accessing the <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/50states.htm\">Department of Social Services 50 states</a> web site or the Family Support Division’s <a href=\"http://dssweb/fsd/administration/publicservicedirectory/index.htm\">Public Human Services Agency Directory</a> web site. Staff will click on each appropriate state to obtain contact information for verifying any child abuse/neglect history for each household member 17 years of age and older for each state they resided in since 17 years of age.&nbsp;</p><p>To further enhance a comprehensive C/AN background check, resource/licensing staff also need to enter the residence address of the resource home on the State Highway Patrol’s sexual offender list located on the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240226050914/https://statepatrol.dps.mo.gov/\">Missouri Highway Patrol</a>’s website.

Resource Home Adverse Action Letter, the CS-20a and the title change for the CS-20. &nbsp;</p><p>The CS-20 is being changed from the Foster/Relative Home Action Report to the Resource Home Adverse Action Report. &nbsp;This change is to better reflect the purpose of this form which is to make recommendations for adverse actions to any of our resource family homes – foster, relative, kinship and adoptive. &nbsp;</p><p>The Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action letter is to be utilized when such an action is being recommended to a licensed or approved home or to an application for resource home licensure or adoptive home approval. &nbsp;An adverse action would be any denial, involuntary suspension or revocation of a resource home license, adoptive home approval, or application for licensure or approval. &nbsp;The Notification of Resource Home Adverse Action letter was developed to provide a consistent means of notifying an applicant or resource provider of the adverse action recommended and the appeal process available to them. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Staff are to begin using the new CS-20a effective with the date of this memorandum. &nbsp;The letter is available online at <a href=\"http://www.dss.mo.gov/cd/info/forms/index.htm\">http://www.dss.mo.gov/cd/info/forms/index.htm</a>. &nbsp;A copy should be retained in the provider’s files in the Correspondence Section. &nbsp;</p><p>Resource family closed files are to be maintained ten (10) years from the date of last closing; withdrawn applications shall also be kept for 10 years from date of withdrawal. &nbsp;However, resource home revocation and denial information will be retained at the local level indefinitely. &nbsp;This is necessary to support any decisions we have made that come into question at a later date through sources such as the Family Care Safety Registry (FCSR). &nbsp;This information will be kept in the Administrative Section of the licensing record until the record is due for expungement. &nbsp;At that time, CS-20, CS-20a and any supporting documentation will be placed in a separate administrative file which is to be maintained in the local office indefinitely.&nbsp;</p><table style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0px;color:rgb(21, 21,

Information on all of the changes to the Foster Home Licensing Rules was provided in memorandum <strong>CD07-36</strong>. One addition to the rules is the requirement for in-service training hours. The rules now in effect require each foster parent to complete a prescribed number of training hours as approved by the Children’s Division (CD). The current requirement is 15 hours per year or 30 hours per licensing period (except Career foster parents who are required to complete 16 hours per year or 32 hours per licensing period.)&nbsp;</p><p>The newly revised Foster Parent Bill of Rights and Responsibilities (RSMo 210.566) states “the Children's Division and its contractors shall provide foster parents with regularly scheduled opportunities for pre-service training and pertinent in-service training, as determined by the Missouri State Foster Care and Adoption Advisory Board.” Section 1 Chapter 3 of the Child Welfare Manual states that placement resources have the right to have and participate in pre-service training and continuing education for their role as placement providers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PRE-SERVICE TRAINING</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Foster Home Licensing Rules require that each adult with parenting responsibilities successfully complete a competency-based training approved by the licensing agency prior to licensure. The required pre-service training curriculum for CD is <em><strong>STARS</strong></em> (Specialized Training, Assessment, Resources, Support and Skills). This requirement also applies to relative and kinship caregivers. The pre-service training currently provided to relative and kinship caregivers is <em><strong>STARS</strong></em> for the Caregiver Who Knows the Child. The caregiver training can be provided as either a self-study or in a group setting.</p><p>Foster and kinship providers desiring to adopt must attend an additional training prior to being approved as an adoptive resource. This training is known as <em><strong>STARS</strong></em>, <em>Making the Commitment to Adoption</em> (also known as Spaulding) pre-service training. Relatives considering adoption are encouraged to complete the Spaulding training, but it is not required.</p><p><em><strong>STARS </strong></em>and Spaulding are co-taught by a professional staff member of the agency or contracted provider and an experienced and contracted teaching foster parent.&nbsp;</p><p>The <em><strong>STARS</strong></em> curriculum is not specifically named in the new licensing rules so that CD may consider training from other states as a way to meet the requirement. This will allow CD to consider licensure of foster parents who move to Missouri from other states if their prior training meets the competency based requirement. The code to be utilized when entering the Pre-Service training of these foster homes is V099 “Other Approved Pre-Service Training”. Further information on the acceptance of non-STARS pre-service training will be forthcoming.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IN-SERVICE TRAINING</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>In-service training is a requirement for continued foster parent licensure and must be completed at the time of re-licensure. Foster care, relative and kinship providers are required to receive and participate in in-service training every licensure period. Relative and kinship care providers may choose not to attend in-service training but should be encouraged to do so. If these providers do not obtain the required in-service hours, they are not eligible to receive the $100 Professional Parenting payment. The process for working with foster homes who do not meet the requirement for in-service hours can be located in the Child Welfare Manual, Section 6 Chapter 3 Attachment D.&nbsp;</p><p>In-service training can be obtained from the following sources:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>STARS In-Service training modules are available and completion of a specific module should be based on the identified need in the Professional Family Development Plan. The modules are now available on DVD also. Staff may access the DVDs through supervisory channels;</li><li>Local training resources which are developed within their own community;</li><li>Other approved in-service training (must have prior approval by the Regional office if the placement provider is requesting the CD cover the cost or if they are requesting the hours be counted toward meeting training requirements). Other approved in-service training should be flexible and competency based. Competency takes into account the person’s knowledge, skill, willingness, and ability to practice and perform the desired parenting to meet the needs of the children in our care. Flexibility can be allowed for training to occur in various formats such as, but not limited to, small or large group sessions, individual study, readings, coaching, web trainings, conferences, college courses, etc. Staff should consult with their Regional office to determine hours of “other approved in-service training” and if the training addresses the competencies required in agency policy.</li></ul><p><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Section 6 Chapter 2 Resource Provider Training – STARS has been updated. The information contained in 6.2 Attachment A: STARS Training Objectives, 6.2 Attachment B: Pre-Service and In-Service Training, STARS Competencies; 6.2 Attachment C: Foster Parent Training; and 6.2 Attachment D: Guidelines for Award of Credit for NonAgency Training are now subsections incorporated into Section 6 Chapter 2.&nbsp;</p><p>The terminology of Non-Agency Training previously used in the Child Welfare manual is now referred to as “Other Approved In-Service Training”.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SS-60 B FORM, CODE SHEET, AND INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The SS-60B has been updated and is now available online.&nbsp;</p><p>The SS-60B code sheet previously had terminology regarding “outside training” on codes V199, V299, V399, V499, V799, V899, and V999. The terminology for these codes has now been updated to “Other Approved In-Service Training”. The code V099 is being added for “Other Approved Pre-Service Training”. All training is either preservice or in-service. Staff should begin using the new code sheet immediately.</p><p>The SS-60B Instructions and form have also been updated.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</li><li>Review this memorandum with all licensed foster, relative and kinship care providers.</li><li>Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.&nbsp;</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and directed to:</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PDS CONTACT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Stefanie Wickers&nbsp;</p><p>573-751-1354&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Stefanie.D.Wickers@dss.mo.gov\">Stefanie.D.Wickers@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td><p><strong>PROGRAM MANAGER:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Melody Yancey&nbsp;</p><p>573-526-8040&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Melody.Yancey@dss.mo.gov\">Melody.Yancey@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS</strong>:&nbsp;</p><p>Section 6 Chapter 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2index.htm\">Index</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Section 6 Chapter 2.1 <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2sub1.htm\">Mandate And Rationale&nbsp;</a></p><p>Section 6 Chapter 2.2 <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2sub2.htm\">Working With Prospective Foster/ Adoptive Parents</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Section 6 Chapter 2.3 <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2sub3.htm\">STARS Training Objectives</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Section 6 Chapter 2.4 <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2sub4.htm\">Pre-Service Training And STARS Competencies</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Section 6 Chapter 2.5 <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2sub5.htm\">In-Service Training</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Section 6 Chapter 2.6 <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/cd/info/cwmanual/section6/ch2/sec6ch2sub6.htm\">Other Approved Training</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Attachments A – D of Section 6 Chapter 2 have been deleted.

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>DISCUSSION:</p><p>The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce the Foster Family Profile into policy, which was briefly discussed in Children’s Division memorandum CD06-77. The Foster Family Profile was first introduced in the Code of State Regulations. The profile will provide the Family Support Team (FST) with a more comprehensive picture of the foster family, allowing for a better matching process when determining placement for foster youth. These policy changes will bring the Child Welfare Manual in compliance with 13 CSR 35-60.030. The Foster Family Profile cover letter (CD-55) is now available to provide the potential resource provider with an explanation of the purpose of the Foster Family Profile (CD-56). Having the Foster Family Profile available to the Children’s Service Worker (CSW) and the FST will enable them to utilize the form when making placement decisions that are in the best interest of the child.</p><p><strong>Existing Resource Providers&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Existing resource providers are to complete the Foster Family Profile at the time of license renewal. The CSW is to provide the resource provider with the Foster Family Profile cover letter (CD-55) and the Foster Family Profile (CD-56) for completion during this time. Resource providers are to return the form to their local licensing worker within no more than ten business days. The profile should then be updated by the foster parents as needed with subsequent household changes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>New Resource Providers&nbsp;</strong></p><p>At the first in-home family consultation meeting the CSW should provide the applicant with the Foster Family Profile cover letter (CD-55) and the Foster Family Profile (CD-56) for completion. The applicant is to return the completed CD-56 to the local licensing worker within 10 business days. <strong>The CD-56 is required as a part of concluding the home study process and is to be received prior to scheduling the last in-home consultation.</strong></p><p>The completed CD-56 and a photograph of the resource provider’s family are to be under separate cover sheet (to be developed locally) and placed in the front of the resource provider’s record.</p><p><strong>Utilization of the Foster Family Profile&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The CSW should assess and review the Foster Family Profiles of potential resource providers as a part of the process of selecting a placement for the child. When the CSW is meeting with the FST to discuss placement changes for a child, the Foster Family Profiles of possible resource providers are to be available for the FST to review. The FST is to utilize the information in the profiles in making its determination and selection of a placement for a child or sibling group. A thorough review of potential resource providers will assist the FST in selecting an appropriate placement that can meet the needs and serve in the best interest of the child.</p><p><strong>Documentation and Maintenance&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The CSW should document in the initial recording that the applicant was provided and given a brief overview of the Foster Family cover letter (CD-55), and the Foster Family Profile (CD-56). In regards to subsequent recordings, the CSW should document discussions regarding the Foster Family Profile. The CD-56 is to be updated when there are changes in the household composition that impact the information gathered on the form. The most recent CD-56 with a recent photograph of the family attached is to be kept in the front of the Resource Provider record.

Section 453.121 RSMo has been amended by House Bill 1414.&nbsp;</p><p>The terms “identifying information”, “lineal descendant” and “non-identifying information” have been amended and/or redefined by this legislation:&nbsp;</p><p>“Identifying information” is now defined as <strong>individually identifying information for or about a unique individual, including information likely to disclose the contact information, location, or identity of such individual. “&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Lineal descendant” is now defined in<strong> Section 472.010 RSMo.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Non-identifying information” is now defined as<strong> information that is not identifying information.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The most significant change made by this legislation is the mandate to release all information to an adult adoptee if the adult adoptee’s biological parent had their parental rights terminated through a nonconsensual or involuntary termination of parental rights proceeding.</p><p>This addition means adult adoptees who register with the adoption information registry or petition the court for release of information will have access to all information, including identifying information about the biological parent, but only if parental rights were terminated involuntarily. If the parental rights were terminated voluntarily, current policy regarding disclosure of identifying information pertaining to the adopted adult's biological parents still applies.</p><p>As part of the effort to prepare biological parents for termination of parental rights, it is essential that parents be informed of their rights on issues related to the release of their information. Staff have a duty to explain that this law allows identifying information is to be shared with adult adoptees when termination of parental rights occurred because of an involuntary or nonconsensual termination proceeding. Biological parents, who are voluntarily terminating their parental rights, are to be informed of the process, outlined in the law, to file an affidavit with the court, which allows or prohibits release of identifying information to an adult adoptee or their lineal descendants.&nbsp;</p><p>As a part of adoption planning, adoptive parents and youth, if age appropriate, are to be made aware of the adopted child’s rights at age 18 to obtain information about their biological parents. Adoptive parents are to be made aware of the right of their adopted youth to register with the Missouri Adoption Information Registry at age 18 and are to be provided the Registry brochure.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</li><li>Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.&nbsp;</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and directed to:</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PDS CONTACT</strong></p><p>Vickie Stoneberger</p><p>573-751-0311</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Vickie.Stoneberger@dss.mo.gov\">Vickie.Stoneberger@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td><p><strong>MANAGER CONTACT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Amy Martin&nbsp;</p><p>573-526-8040</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Amy.L.Martin@dss.mo.gov\">Amy.L.Martin@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Section 5, Chapter 3, Adopted Adult Requesting Identifying Information and Adopted Adult Requesting Non-Identifying Information</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>NA</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>REFERENCE DOCUMENTS AND RESOURCES&nbsp;</strong></p><p>NA</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>RELATED STATUTE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>RSMo 453.121</p></td></tr></tbody></table>\n  </div>"

This memo also introduces Children’s Division’s commitment to the Governor’s Committee to End Homelessness (GCEH) discharge policy. Research indicates that housing instability and homelessness significantly contribute to parental stress and increase the risk factors associated with child abuse and neglect. Research also indicates that older youth who transition out of foster care are at heightened risk of housing instability and homelessness due to a limited number of personal permanent connections, trauma experience, and limited access to resources after experiencing foster care.&nbsp;</p><p>The CES is Missouri’s primary resource to connect people to housing services by providing Access Points across the state with the primary goal of providing services, no matter where or how people present. This resource allows staff to connect youth and families to Missouri’s array of housing services with one referral to an Access Point. A listing of Coordinated Entry Access Points by region and county can be found <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220811022458/https://dmh.mo.gov/media/pdf/coordinated-entry-directory-missouri-continuums-care-cocs\">here.</a> All Access Point agencies will complete a pre-screening tool with clients and connect them with the appropriate level of housing services. More detail about Missouri’s Coordinated Entry System can be found <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230409071622/https://www.endhomelessnessmo.org/housing-resources\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the CES can be utilized on behalf of any family or youth served by CD at any point of involvement, a referral should be made when housing stability is the primary barrier to successful AC case closure. The Child Welfare Manual has been updated to include instructions about when to apply this policy and how to document efforts to secure permanent housing.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of membership on the GCEH, CD partners with community, state and federal organizations to follow the guiding principles and procedures of the GCEH discharge policy when serving families and older youth who are experiencing homelessness or at risk for homelessness. This means that CD will continue to engage families and older youth in their discharge planning, integrate community resources to reduce duplication of services, and collaborate with community partners to achieve effective discharge planning during the course of case management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</li><li>Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.&nbsp;</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and directed to:</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PDS CONTACT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Natalie Allen</p><p>314-416-2748</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Natalie.N.Allen@dss.mo.gov\">Natalie.N.Allen@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td><p><strong>MANAGER CONTACT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ivy Doxley&nbsp;</p><p>573-526-1422</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:Ivy.C.Doxley@dss.mo.gov\">Ivy.C.Doxley@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://fostercaresystems.byu.edu/rules/MO/289\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"bfdee9db-afac-4f73-9375-193cfbc80828\" data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" title=\"MO :: Section 4, Chapter 10 (Case Management Activities), Subsection 1 – Permanency And Case Planning\">Section 4, Chapter 10 (Case Management Activities), Subsection 1 – Permanency and Case Planning</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://fostercaresystems.byu.edu/rules/MO/360\">Section 4, Chapter 5 (Older Youth Program), Subsection 9 – Exit Plan</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/khsqsxxmhd1u9wzvkenotp3al94szatw\">Governor’s Committee to End Homelessness Discharge Policy</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>REFERENCE DOCUMENTS AND RESOURCES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220811022458/https://dmh.mo.gov/media/pdf/coordinated-entry-directory-missouri-continuums-care-cocs\">Coordinated Entry Access Points</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230409071622/https://www.endhomelessnessmo.org/housing-resources\">Coordinated Entry Full Description</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>RELATED STATUTE</strong></p><p>(List or put N/A if not applicable.)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>DISCUSSION</p><p>The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce the state legislative requirements and new case management practices concerning youth bank accounts. In 2018 the state legislature passed Section 431.056, RSMo., which states that, “A minor who is sixteen years of age or older and who is in the legal custody of the children's division, pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction shall be qualified and competent to contract for the opening of a checking or savings bank account with the consent of the children's division or the juvenile court. The minor shall be responsible for paying all banking related costs associated with the checking or savings account and shall be liable for any and all penalties should he or she violate a banking agreement. No state department, foster parent, or entity providing case management of children on behalf of a department shall be responsible for paying any bank fees nor liable for any and all penalties related to violation of a CCS SB 819 44 banking agreement.”&nbsp;</p><p>This statute and related policy enhances the implementation of the \"Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard,” to reduce the systemic barriers which keep youth from participating in enrichment and skill development opportunities comparable to their peers who are not in care. Because youth in legal custody of the Children’s Division experience challenges in developing long term supportive relationships with trusted adults, they are less likely to have an appropriate co-signer when opening a bank account. The experience of managing a bank account when youth begin working or handling their own money is an important developmental experience which can help prepare them for independence as adults. This statute and policy ensure that being in the legal custody of Children’s Division is not a barrier to youth having a bank account and provides protocol for Children’s Service Workers to assist youth seeking to open a bank account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</li><li>Review revised Child Welfare Manual chapters as indicated below.&nbsp;</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and directed to:</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PDS CONTACT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Natalie Allen&nbsp;</p><p>314-416-2748&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Natalie.N.Allen@dss.mo.gov\">Natalie.N.Allen@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td><p><strong>MANAGER CONTACT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ivy Doxley&nbsp;</p><p>573-526-1422&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Ivy.C.Doxley@dss.mo.gov\">Ivy.C.Doxley@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230128205326/https://dssmanuals.mo.gov/child-welfare-manual/section-4-chapter-5-older-youth-program-subsection-6-credit-reports/\">Section 4 Chapter 5.1.2 Youth Bank Accounts</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Consent Letter Youth Bank Accounts <a href=\"http://dssweb/cs/forms/pdf/cd277.pdf\">CD-277</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>REFERENCE DOCUMENTS AND RESOURCES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/eyf0qfy4wvt850tozgkjxd70vnzefgmm\">Checklist for Opening a Bank Account or Credit Union Account&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230619221955/https://www.casey.org/casey-life-skills/\">Resources to Inspire/Casey Life Skills (Pages 34-35)</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>RELATED STATUTE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>RSMo 431.056</p></td></tr></tbody></table>\n  </div>"

A section is provided to document the youth’s assent (for ages 12-17), and a field to document parental notification. Parents/legal guardians – absent a court order restricting their access - and resource parents should be notified of, and encouraged to attend or participate in, all appointments.&nbsp;</p><p>A copy of the completed form must be uploaded through document imaging and maintained in the case file until further notice per Director Memo TD17-09.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION&nbsp;</strong></p><p>1.

Family Self Help Center is a Women’s and Children’s CSTAR (Comprehensive Substance Treatment and Rehabilitation) facility licensed and contracted with Department of Mental Health. Missouri Women’s and Children’s CSTAR providers provide and arrange for individual and family counseling, parenting skills and training, and parent education as required by FFPSA. Family Self Help Center also meets the “Trauma Informed” criteria required by FFPSA.&nbsp;</p><p>To qualify for maintenance payments, the recommendation for placement at Family Self Help Center must be agreed up by the Family Support Team and documented in the child's case plan <strong>before</strong> the placement. The recommendation should be documented initially in a Contact Note and then on the Child Assessment and Service Plan (CS-1). Placement with a parent at Family Self Help Center can only be considered for the following eligible youth:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eligibility:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Eligible youth have been physically removed from a home pursuant to a court order. A “legal” or “constructive” removal is acceptable.</li><li>There must be a judicial determination signed by a judge stating that remaining in the home would be contrary to the child’s welfare or that out of home placement would be in the child’s best interest. This determination must be made in the very first court order that authorizes the removal of the child from the home, regardless of whether there is an emergency or a non-emergency. If the judicial determination is not made in the very first court order pertaining to removal, the child will not be Title IV-E eligible for the duration of the child’s stay in foster care;&nbsp;</li><li>A judicial determination of reasonable efforts to prevent a child’s removal from the home or a statement that reasonable efforts are not required must be specified in a court order and must be made no later than 60 days from the date the child is removed from the home. If the judicial determination is not made timely the child’s foster care maintenance payments will not be eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement for the duration of the child’s stay in foster care;</li></ul><p>For tracking and payment purposes and to implement this opportunity for families more quickly, CD will initially track placement of eligible youth by using placement type <strong>“CTO”</strong> on the placement screen in FACES, which is currently used for non-licensed court ordered facilities. The name of the facility must be entered with address, telephone number and residence county as follows:&nbsp;</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">Family Self Help Center&nbsp;</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">PO Box 1765&nbsp;</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">Joplin, MO 64804&nbsp;</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">Jasper County&nbsp;</p><p>Once the case managing office receives an invoice from Family Self Help Center, payment should be made directly to Family Self Help Center. CD staff will use the FACES Financial Management Payment Request process to pay using Vendor number <strong>001418559</strong>, program area “AC” with “MM” Vendor type. The Service Code is “MAIN”.&nbsp;</p><p>The maintenance rates CD currently uses to pay vendors that are not licensed by CD will be used to pay qualified SUD (Substance Use Disorder) treatment facilities as illustrated in the table below:</p><p><strong>Standard Payment Rate for Family Based Residential Vendors</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Expenditure</td><td>Age Limitation</td><td>Amount Payable</td></tr><tr><td>1. Maintenance for Children placed with Parent in SUD Family Based Residential facility licensed by the Department of Mental Health</td><td><p>0-5 years&nbsp;</p><p>6-12 years&nbsp;</p><p>13 and over</p></td><td><p>$300.00</p><p>$356.00</p><p>$396.00</p></td></tr><tr><td>2. Infant Allowance</td><td>0-3 years</td><td>$50.00</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A FACES systems change has been requested; a new placement code of “<strong>FBR</strong>” (Family Based Residential) will be created and will eventually replace the use of the CTO placement code for these types of placements. Staff will be alerted when the FBR placement code is available for use. The FBR code will allow the FACES system to track these placements once FBR is implemented and used.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently Family Self Help Center is the only facility that meets the requirements of the Family First Prevention Services Act for reimbursement. Staff will be alerted when additional SUD treatment facilities meet the FFPSA qualifications to receive maintenance payments for youth in CD custody placed with a parent in residential SUD treatment.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>NECESSARY ACTION&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Review this memorandum with all Children’s Division staff.&nbsp;</li><li>All questions should be cleared through normal supervisory channels and directed to:</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PDS CONTACT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Jason Kearbey&nbsp;</p><p>573-592-1007&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Jason.L.Kearbey@dss.mo.gov\">Jason.L.Kearbey@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td><td><p><strong>MANAGER CONTACT&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ivy Doxley&nbsp;</p><p>573-526-1422&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"mailto:Ivy.Doxley@dss.mo.gov\">Ivy.Doxley@dss.mo.gov</a></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>CHILD WELFARE MANUAL REVISIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>REFERENCE DOCUMENTS AND RESOURCES</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>RELATED STATUTE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>Caregivers serve as parents to a pregnant and/or parenting youth, who parents their child. The foster youth, as a parent, has the same legal rights and responsibilities as any parent, even if the youth is a minor (under 18 years old). Caregivers, the caseworker, the agency and DCFS provide the environment and supports to allow the youth to become self-sufficient and be able to live independently. In most cases, both the youth and his or her children live together with the foster family.&nbsp;</p><p>Caregivers of youth who are pregnant and/or parenting:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>have primary responsibility for the youth and a secondary responsibility for his or her children;&nbsp;</li><li>receive a board payment for the youth, but not for his or her child or children;&nbsp;</li><li>receive a special service fee per child with the normal board rate to pass on to the parenting youth to purchase necessities for the child, such as diapers or clothing; and&nbsp;</li><li>must have a foster parent license which accommodates both the youth and his or her child or children living in the foster home. Example: A teen mom and her baby living with the foster family takes up two spaces of a foster family license, although the youth's baby is not a child in foster care.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This unique dynamic of parenting a youth who is parenting a child presents implied responsibilities for the caregivers of:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>modeling how to be a responsible adult; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Examples: Budgeting money, keeping appointments, seeking medical care</em></li><li>modeling parenting to teach the youth how to parent. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Example: Teaching a youth how to appropriately discipline a two-year-old</em></li><li>being involved with the father or mother of the youth's child due to visits, dating, medical situations, or others situations involving the other youthful parent;&nbsp;</li><li>working closely with the caseworker and medical professionals with issues related to fostering a youth who is sexually active;&nbsp;</li><li>letting the youth take personal responsibility for the welfare of his or her child, while ensuring the safety and welfare of the child.&nbsp;</li><li>Caregivers must be careful observers and are mandated reporters in reporting abuse or neglect of, not only the youth, but also the youth's child. But, caregivers must be able to parent the youth like any other — without using the DCFS hotline to intercede if the youth stays out late, or displays other normal teen behavior; and&nbsp;</li><li>guiding the youth through educational and vocational decisions which will influence their future and the future of their child/ren, with the caseworker.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>If you may be interested in fostering a pregnant and/or parenting teen, supports are available. (See pages 33-34.) If a child in your care becomes pregnant, notify the caseworker to get connected to services.</p><p><strong>Supports for Caregivers of Pregnant or Parenting Youth&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Special Programs&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In Cook County, DCFS contracts with one agency to oversee the foster care programs designed to support both the foster family and the pregnant or parenting teen and his or her child/ren living with the foster family. If you would consider fostering a pregnant and/or parenting teen, ask your agency about becoming a foster family within this program.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside Cook County, caregivers will find general support through their agency and caseworker.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Special Service Fees&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A special service fee is available to caregivers serving the parenting population. DCFS can approve this fee for the provision of items for a parenting foster youth that are over and above board payment needs of the caregiver.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Supports for Pregnant and/or Parenting Foster Youth&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Youth in foster care are not eligible to receive Public Aid because they are already receiving supports through DCFS as a child under state care. There are additional supports available.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Medical Card&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A pregnant and/or parenting youth, as a child in the foster care system, receives a medical card.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Independent Living&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Services Pregnant and/or parenting teens will receive life skills assessment, transition planning and supportive services through their caseworker. A life skills curriculum which specifically addresses the specialized needs of pregnant and parenting teenagers has been developed and is being utilized statewide.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Education</strong></p><p>Encouraging the youth to stay in school and guiding the youth through decisions about educational alternatives, with the caseworker, is one of the most important functions of the caregiver. Some local school districts have programs just for pregnant and/or parenting teens. The youth's caseworker and the agency should be able to help you find information about these programs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Day Care&nbsp;</strong></p><p>One of the most important supports available is day care for the youth's child or children, which enables the youth to stay in school.&nbsp;</p><p>Other support programs meeting the individual needs of the teen are available through DCFS, contracted community agencies, the local school district, the Illinois State Board of Education and other state governmental departments.</p><p><strong>Supports for Children of Foster Youth&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Food Stamps:</strong> Children of foster youth are usually eligible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Medical Card: </strong>Children of foster youth each receive a medical card which covers medical care and prescriptions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Special Service Fee:</strong> The special service fee added to the monthly payment check of the caregiver should be given to the foster youth to spend on the care of his/ her child/ren, not to include day care.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WIC:</strong> Women, Infants and Children — Children of foster youth may be eligible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rights of Pregnant and/or Parenting Teens&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Families providing or considering foster care to youth, <strong>male or female</strong>, who are pregnant or have a child that they take care of need to understand the youth's rights and what services are available to the teen and their child.&nbsp;</p><p>Youth in foster care who are pregnant, or have a child they are caring for have these rights:</p><ul><li>to be placed in a stable, safe place to live with their child, unless a separate placement is necessary for safety or treatment reasons;</li><li>to continue their education and obtain a high school diploma even though they are pregnant or a parent;</li><li>to receive necessary day care for their child/ren at no cost to them;&nbsp;</li><li>to receive necessary transportation to and from the day care while they attend school;&nbsp;</li><li>to receive appropriate services necessary to help them achieve in school. Examples: Tutoring and GED preparation;</li><li>to receive information and services to prevent pregnancy or make decisions about pregnancy and parenting;</li><li>to receive any necessary ongoing prenatal, medical, or dental care wherever they live;&nbsp;</li><li>to actively participate in the care and support of their child/ren by having appropriate regular visits when they do not have physical custody of them;</li><li>to receive appropriate services, such as counseling, to help them with any problems they may have;&nbsp;</li><li>to have necessary assistance in learning to be a better parent or how to live on their own;</li><li>to receive help planning to use their monthly funds for the adequate care of their child/ren;</li><li>to be free of discrimination based on their status as being pregnant or a parent.</li><li>to continue to receive appropriate services as long as they are in DCFS care, which may continue until age 21 if necessary; and</li><li>to leave a mental health facility after staff of that facility state that they are no longer in need of mental health hospitalization.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Written Notice of Rights and How to Appeal Decisions&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All pregnant and/or parenting teens receive a written notice of these rights at the first Administrative Case Review (ACR). If they believe 1) they or their child/ren require additional or different services, 2) they need a different placement or, 3) their rights as described have been ignored, this notice instructs them to request help at the ACR or to contact their case manager.&nbsp;</p><p>If their request for help is denied, they may appeal the decision by sending a written request to DCFS within 45 calendar days of the date of the notice of the decision. This same notice gives the teen the DCFS address to use in filing the appeal as well as the address and phone number of the Legal Assistance Foundation of Chicago (800-824-4050) where they may get legal information or help.</p>\n  </div>"

There may however, be individual situations where part-time employment for the primary Level B resource provider would be reasonable for that home and family. It is also possible on rare occasions that the unique circumstances in a given family would warrant a formal exception to full time employment. (Example could include a Level B home with a trained relative living close by, a teacher’s aide working in the same school as the child(ren) or a family recruited for one specific child.)</p><p style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);box-sizing:border-box;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;margin:0px 0px 10px;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">Submission of Plan for Employment</strong></p><p style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);box-sizing:border-box;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;margin:0px 0px 10px;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\">For consistency and assurance of good practice, all primary Level B resource parents caregivers interested in working should submit to their local case manager a thorough, complete plan for meeting the needs of the child while at work.

Elevated Needs Level B care <strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">IS NOT</strong> permanency but is designed to be a stepping stone for the youth to obtain a permanent home.&nbsp;&nbsp; As these youth do have a variety of special needs, the goal of successful permanency can be challenging. Accordingly, resource parents, staff, and other treatment team members must aggressively pursue permanency and use periodic reviews as one of the tools to assure progress toward permanency is occurring.</p><p style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);box-sizing:border-box;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;margin:0px 0px 10px;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\">To assist youth in achieving a permanent home, it is important that the resource parent and the team tailor the level of intensity and intervention to their needs as youth achieve progress and success. The dilemma for the teams may be how to move the youth to the appropriate level of intervention, such as Level A or traditional foster care, without moving the youth from the current resource home. Ideally, youth who improve in Level B care and are ready for less intensive care could move directly to their permanent home. When that is not possible, the next best solution is to keep the youth in the same resource home under the category of Level A, traditional foster care (depending on the youth’s needs) or pre-adoptive home. Youth who are happy in their resource home and are experiencing success should not be moved to a different resource home solely due to no longer needing Level B intervention. Staff, resource parents and the team members must assess each individual situation carefully and negotiate an outcome that is in that youth’s best interests. As noted, the periodic reviews are a critical tool for assuring the youth’s level of intervention is matching their needs and that permanency is on target. As always, the best interest of the youth is the guiding principal with these complex decisions.</p><p style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);box-sizing:border-box;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;margin:0px 0px 10px;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\">Situations where there is disagreement among team members as to continuing need for intervention and/or the appropriate plan for the youth should be referred to the Regional Director or designee for consultation.</p><p style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);box-sizing:border-box;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;margin:0px 0px 10px;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\">Periodic Review schedule</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);box-sizing:border-box;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;list-style-type:disc;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:0px;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\" type=\"disc\"><li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">Six (6) months – Multi-disciplinary Selection/Screening team that originally recommended placement with the resource parents and/or the Family Support Team.

Elevated Needs Level A care <strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">IS NOT</strong> permanency but is designed to be a stepping stone for the youth to obtain a permanent home.&nbsp;&nbsp; As these youth do have a variety of special needs, the goal of successful permanency can be challenging. Accordingly, resource parents, staff, and other treatment team members must aggressively pursue permanency and use periodic reviews as one of the tools to assure progress toward permanency is occurring.</p><p style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);box-sizing:border-box;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;margin:0px 0px 10px;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\">To assist youth in achieving a permanent home, it is important that the resource parent and the team tailor the level of intensity and intervention to their needs as youth achieve progress and success. The dilemma for the teams may be how to move the youth to the appropriate level of intervention without moving the youth from the current resource home. Ideally, youth who improve in Level A care and are ready for less intensive care could move directly to their permanent home. When that is not possible, the next best solution is to keep the youth in the same resource home under the category of traditional foster care or pre-adoptive home. Youth who are happy in their resource home and are experiencing success should not be moved to a different resource home solely due to no longer needing Level A intervention. Staff, resource parents and the team members must assess each individual situation carefully and negotiate an outcome that is in that youth’s best interests. As noted, the periodic reviews are a critical tool for assuring the youth’s level of intervention is matching their needs and that permanency is on target. As always, the best interest of the youth is the guiding principal with these complex decisions.</p><p style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);box-sizing:border-box;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;margin:0px 0px 10px;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\">Situations where there is disagreement among team members as to continuing need for intervention and/or the appropriate plan for the youth should be referred to the Regional Director or designee for consultation.</p><p style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);box-sizing:border-box;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;margin:0px 0px 10px;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;\">Periodic Review schedule</strong></p><p style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);box-sizing:border-box;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Tahoma, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;margin:0px 0px 10px;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\">Six (6) months – Multi-disciplinary Selection/Screening team that originally recommended placement with the resource parents and/or the Family Support Team.

APP Status worksheet is used by the SSI coordinator to report the status of the benefit application for children identified by state office as potentially eligible for benefits.

The SSI coordinator indicates these children by marking a <em>3</em> in the SOU (source) column. The coding allows for queries for these children.</p><p class=\"bodytextdfps\" style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);color:rgb(36, 36, 36);font-family:proxima-nova, &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:1.46666;margin:12pt 0in 0.0001pt 1in;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\">The SSI coordinator enters an application status on this page for any child identified on the report.

Once the award is obtained, the <em>P</em> status changes to <em>C</em> (current recipient) status and the AWD Status worksheet is updated to include the lump sum award and the current monthly benefit.</p><p class=\"bodytextdfps\" style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);color:rgb(36, 36, 36);font-family:proxima-nova, &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:1.46666;margin:12pt 0in 0.0001pt 1in;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\">If the child received a lump sum award but is no longer eligible for benefits, the status is changed to either <em>A</em> (Title IV-E foster care), <em>L</em> (left care/18 year of age), or <em>N</em> (not disabled/improved). If at any point the SSI coordinator decides not to submit an application, the <em>P</em> status is changed to an <em>N</em> status, or other appropriate status code.</p><p class=\"bodytextdfps\" style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);color:rgb(36, 36, 36);font-family:proxima-nova, &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:15px;font-style:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:1.46666;margin:12pt 0in 0.0001pt 1in;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-decoration-color:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;\">Currently there is not a method for separating the children by unit level. In regions where there is more than one SSI coordinator, each coordinator will receive the same quarterly report for the region. When the SSI coordinator identifies a child with P or H status, he or she modifies the REG (the region number; column B) column to include the first letter of the city where the coordinator is located. (For example, a Region 3 Dallas case in either <em>P</em> or <em>H</em> status will read <em>3D</em> in the REG column.) A letter can be added by clicking on the block to be modified in the REG column and pressing the F2 function key on the keyboard. The letter is typed next to the number already there.</p><p class=\"bodytextdfps\" style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);color:rgb(36, 36,

The following is a non-exhaustive list of factors to consider:</p><ul><li>Whenever possible, try to keep a child or youth in the same placement. Transferring children to new caregivers tends to disrupt their progress towards achieving permanency.</li><li>If a child’s or youth’s placement changes, make sure that decisions about the child’s next placement address the child’s need for a safe, permanent home and their ability to remain connected to their family and community, if appropriate. If possible, the child’s or youth’s next placement should represent a step towards achieving permanency.</li><li>The child should be consulted in an age-appropriate manner regarding any placement changes before the placement change occurs to ensure that any factors that are important to the child are considered.</li><li>When a child’s progress towards achieving permanency appears to be stalled, involve the program director in the case (or anyone else who may be helpful) to (i) identify the obstacles to achieving permanency, and to (ii) specify tasks and time frames for overcoming the obstacles. Consider referring the case for a Family Group Conference.</li><li>Always remain aware that children and youth entering into DFPS conservatorship are victims of child abuse and maltreatment. A child’s or youth’s ability to cope with trauma varies from one individual to another. A child’s or youth’s resilience to trauma and how the needs of the child or youth are met have a direct impact on permanency outcomes.</li><li>When a case appears to be stalled in court, confer with the attorney representing DFPS in the case to look for ways to bring it to a conclusion.</li><li>CANS assessments must be updated annually, unless the child is in a Community Based Care (CBC) catchment area where the timeline to update the CANS assessment may be different.</li><li>Children must attend court reviews permanency hearings unless specifically excused by the court. A child may participate by electronic means such as telephone, video conferencing, or Skype if there is a prohibitive distance between the child’s placement and the court location.</li><li>Child and Youth voice is an important part of the permanency planning process. It is not something that should just be sought at the moment the plan is being prepared. When a youth’s wishes are not fully considered and addressed with the youth as a participant, positive outcomes are less likely.</li></ul><p>Page 7</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>"

To this end, caseworkers should follow the guidelines specified below:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Every child’s or youth’s caseworker is required to periodically review the original reasons for the child’s or youth’s removal and the situation that currently exists. The crucial question is whether the parent’s protective capacities will manage the danger indicators to allow the child to return to a safe home, and not whether the parent has completed all the services and achieved goals specified in the FPOS. It is important to review and reflect on the parent’s ability to demonstrate behavioral change, not only that they have completed required services. If necessary and appropriate, parents can continue to work on their FPOS and continue their services with the child or youth in the home.&nbsp;</li><li>If parents have made significant progress in reducing danger indicators and increasing their protective capacities, the caseworker should staff the case with the supervisor and program director to discuss possible family reunification planning.

If progress is still not being achieved, a possible change of the permanency goal may be needed. The Reunification Assessment aids in helping to assess the progress of the parent and if a new permanency goal should be considered.&nbsp;</li><li>If a final order has been entered and the child or youth is in DFPS permanent managing conservatorship, (with or without termination of parental rights), the caseworker should continuously re-evaluate the child’s or youth’s circumstances, and address challenges and barriers to the child or youth achieving the permanency goals.

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>Permanency refers to a child exiting from DFPS care into a safe, appropriate, and permanent setting. Planning for permanency begins the moment DFPS makes contact with a child and family. DFPS constantly assesses the family, requests information, and acknowledges members of the child’s and family’s support network in order to engage them in permanency planning. The family’s support network will have valuable information to assist DFPS in making careful and realistic case and permanency plans. Engaging the family and support network may also generate an array of permanent placement options for the child if they cannot return home and is an important part of concurrent planning. The process does not end until a child exits DFPS conservatorship, preferably to a permanent family setting.&nbsp;</p><p>Positive permanency is the philosophy that guides DFPS in permanency planning for children in DFPS conservatorship. Positive permanency means that DFPS seeks an outcome in which the child exits DFPS care into a permanent setting that includes a legal relationship to a family. Positive permanency is achieved when children are reunified, adopted, or permanent custody is given to another individual.&nbsp;</p><p>Every child needs a permanent and stable home, preferably with their family or fictive kin. There is no adequate substitute for stable, permanent family ties. Family ties provide the child with a sense of belonging and connection to the community. When a child cannot return home safely, positive permanency underscores the need for DFPS to actively seek another permanent family setting for the child. If DFPS cannot achieve positive permanency for a child or youth, DFPS must identify, develop, and support connections to caring adults who agree to provide support to the child once they leave foster care.&nbsp;</p><p>DFPS must actively work toward a primary permanency plan and a concurrent permanency plan. Because things can quickly change during a DFPS case, it is DFPS’s responsibility to develop a permanency plan from the beginning and identify permanency options in the event the primary plan is not achieved. Accordingly, staff must continuously engage the family (including parents, relatives, fictive kin, and the current caregivers and their families). DFPS should actively seek to involve relatives and fictive kin in the life of the child regardless of whether the relative and fictive kin are the planned permanent caregiver.</p><p>Page 1</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>Permanent managing conservatorship, or “PMC,” is a legal term in Texas used in child custody cases. It means that a judge appoints a person to be legally responsible for a child without adopting the child. The court can give PMC to someone other than a parent, including DFPS, a relative, a close family friend, or a foster parent. Only a judge can give PMC to another person. The judge decides the rights and responsibilities, depending upon the specific situation. When someone other than a parent is named as permanent managing conservator, he or she is given the right or duty to:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Physically possess the child.&nbsp;</li><li>Choose moral and religious training.&nbsp;</li><li>Provide clothing, food, shelter, and education.&nbsp;</li><li>Provide and consent to medical, psychiatric, psychological, dental, and surgical care.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Get the child’s medical records.&nbsp;</li><li>Receive money that supports the child.&nbsp;</li><li>Hold or give out money that benefits the child.&nbsp;</li><li>Consent to get married.&nbsp;</li><li>Consent to join the armed forces.&nbsp;</li><li>Represent the child in legal issues.&nbsp;</li><li>Make legal decisions.&nbsp;</li><li>Decide where the child lives and goes to school.&nbsp;</li><li>Make other decisions that the child’s parent would normally make.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Once the court names you permanent managing conservator, the judge will dismiss DFPS from the case. This means DFPS will no longer be involved with the child or your family. This also means DFPS will not provide services such as case management, day care, and post-placement services. If you are the child’s kinship foster parent, you will not continue to receive foster care payments after you become permanent managing conservator. (“Foster parent” means you have completed the process to become a foster parent through a child placing agency.) If you are permanent managing conservator and decide to adopt later, you will not receive adoption assistance.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Post-PMC Services in Houston, Corpus Christi, and Edinburg</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Families in the Houston, Corpus Christi, and Edinburg areas who have been granted PMC of a child through DFPS can receive post-permanency services.

These monthly payments are time-limited and may be paid for up to 12 months. You can ask your kinship development worker for more information about the program. If you obtain permanent managing conservatorship (PMC) of the child, and all other eligibility requirements are met, you may request a $500 annual reimbursement for child-related expenses for the three years following the award of PMC, or until the child reaches age 18, whichever comes first.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>College Tuition and Fees Assistance</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>If you became the child’s permanent managing conservator on or after September 1, 2009, the child may be eligible for free college tuition at:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Public colleges or universities.</li><li>Public medical schools.</li><li>Public dental schools.&nbsp;</li><li>Public junior colleges.&nbsp;</li><li>Public technical institutes.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The child must enroll by his or her 25th birthday.

STAR Health Medicaid will also cover most training that you need to care for a child with primary medical needs. To use these services, you must use healthcare providers in the STAR Health network.&nbsp;</p><p>Star Health has a tool on its website called Health Passport. It allows you to see the child’s health information like immunizations, doctor visits, medications, and dental visits.

Managed by the U.S. Social Security Administration, SSI provides a cash benefit to the child. To qualify for benefits, the child must be younger than age 18 and meet the SSI disability, income, and asset criteria. Children younger than age 18 are eligible for Social Security benefits under Old-Age Survivors and Disability Insurance if the child’s parent is collecting retirement or disability insurance benefits, or if the parent is deceased. Grandparents and other relatives can apply for benefits on behalf of the child based on the work record of the child’s parent.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information, contact a Social Security representative at (800) 772-1213 or go to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250214064729/https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10085.html\">www.ssa.gov/pubs/10085.html [<em>sic</em>, broken link]</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Earned Income Tax Credit</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) helps working people with children.

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>Caring for a child in DFPS custody can be hard. There are many rules and requirements to follow, and some caregivers find it so difficult that they give up or stop trying. As a result, some children in foster care miss out on the benefits and fun of normal childhood activities. Whenever possible, children and youth in foster care should have the chance to participate in normal childhood activities. That’s why federal law allows kinship caregivers to make decisions using what’s called the “reasonable and prudent parent standard.”</p><p><strong>What is the reasonable and prudent parent standard?</strong></p><p>There are many ways to describe what a reasonable and prudent (careful or cautious) parent would do. A parent who is both reasonable and prudent makes decisions carefully and considers the benefits and the possible dangers. This helps the parent come to a sensible decision in the child’s best interest.&nbsp;</p><p>When using the reasonable and prudent parent standard, caregivers must take “reasonable steps” to decide if an activity is a good fit for a child based on the child’s age, maturity, and abilities. There are many different ways to decide whether an activity is a good fit for a child. Here are a few examples of reasonable steps:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Have information about the child so you can make informed decisions. If you feel you do not have enough information, speak with the child’s caseworker.&nbsp;</li><li>Think about the type of activity as well as the child’s mental and physical health and behavioral abilities.&nbsp;</li><li>Think about where the activity will be held, who the child is going with, and when they will return.&nbsp;</li><li>Consider the potential dangers of the activity and what safety issues and supervision the child needs to prevent possible harm.&nbsp;</li><li>Think about all the information you have gathered and ask, “Is this an appropriate activity for a child this age?”&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This law does not apply to parental visits. For information about visits, see the section titled “What visitation rules must be followed?” This law only applies to normal childhood activities, such as sports, sleepovers, and field trips. It allows you, with the appropriate information &nbsp;and training, to make decisions that let kids be kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Page 9</p>\n  </div>"

This recommendation will be discussed at court hearings and meetings called permanency planning meetings. &nbsp;</p><p>Page 7</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>The case may involve a number of different kinds of court proceedings, including those described below.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Emergency Hearings</strong></p><p>&nbsp;If DFPS removes a child from his or her parents’ care without a court order, the court will schedule an emergency hearing for the next working day. This hearing allows the judge to learn why DFPS removed the child and decide if the child should remain in DFPS custody until the adversary hearing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Adversary Hearings&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The court holds an adversary hearing within 14 days of DFPS removing the child from his or her parents. At this hearing, the judge decides whether to return the child to the parents, or if the child would be at risk of continued abuse or neglect in the parents’ care. If the judge does not return the child to the parents, the judge may place the child with a relative or close family friend if that person is appropriate, available, and willing to help. Otherwise, the judge will place the child in foster care. The court also holds an adversary hearing when DFPS seeks a court order to remove a child from his or her parents. This happens when an emergency removal is not necessary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Status Hearings&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The court holds a status hearing within 60 days of placing the child in foster or kinship care. This hearing ensures that the parents have a family service plan and understand they must follow the plan for the child to return home.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Permanency Court Reviews&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Five months after the first adversary hearing, the court will review the parents’ progress on meeting the requirements of the family service plan and making sure the child’s needs are met. Before the hearing, DFPS must:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Submit a “permanency report,” which is a document that gives the agency’s view of the parents’ progress.&nbsp;</li><li>Make a final recommendation on the plan for permanency for the child.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The court may issue additional orders if the judge thinks it is necessary. The court holds additional permanency reviews every four months while the case is in temporary legal status. Within 12 months after the child comes into DFPS custody, the court will either return the child to the parents or give permanent custody to a relative, close family friend, or DFPS. On rare occasions, the court may extend this time for up to six more months, for a total of 18 months.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Permanency Review Hearings After Final Order</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>If a court makes DFPS the child’s permanent managing conservator, the court will review the child’s placement and permanency plans every six months. The court’s focus shifts to making sure DFPS keeps moving toward a permanent placement for the child and continues to monitor that the child’s needs are met.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Parents may lose parental rights to their child if they cannot demonstrate that they can keep the child safe. Only a judge or jury can terminate a parent’s rights. Decisions for each parent must be made separately. If the judge or jury decides to terminate both parents’ rights to a child, the child can be placed for adoption.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do I need to attend court hearings?</strong></p><p>You should always go to court when you get a notice or a phone call about a hearing for the child in your care. The judge will review the child’s and parents’ progress at the court hearing. The judge also will decide where the child will live while the parents participate in services. You should talk with your caseworker about upcoming court hearings so you know when and where they are going to be held. The judge may ask you for input in the hearing. You are allowed, but not required, to talk to the judge about how the child is doing or any needs that the child has.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important for the child to play an active role in the court process. That’s why children 10 years old and older receive their own notice for hearings. The child has the right to attend the hearing and speak to the judge.&nbsp;</p><p>You must discuss the notice with the child. This will help the child if he or she is nervous or confused about the notice or court hearing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Important Information About Court Hearings</strong> &nbsp;</p><ul><li>If you cannot attend a court hearing, notify the caseworker beforehand and give the caseworker an update about the child.</li><li>Talk with the caseworker after the court hearing to find out what happened at court and if there are new orders that affect the child or your household.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: Tell the caseworker or court if you need an interpreter because you cannot speak or understand English, or if you are hearing or speech impaired.</p><p>Page 5</p>\n  </div>"

For example, the Texas Infant, Toddler, and Three-Year-Old Early Learning Guidelines can help families support child development and learning. The guidelines are available in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese at the Texas Early Learning Council’s website: <a href=\"https://www. earlylearningtexas.org/itelg.aspx\">www. earlylearningtexas.org/itelg.aspx[<em>sic</em>, broken link]</a>. If you are concerned the child in your care is not developing like other children the same age, use the free online screening tool at <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250303023227/https://www.easterseals.com/explore-resources/free-confidential-online-child-development-screening\">www.easterseals.com/mtffc/asq</a>. It only takes a few minutes to take one of the Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaires. Results will help you see if the child is developing on schedule and alert you to concerns to discuss with your healthcare provider. Please note that the results do not provide a diagnosis. The tool is only intended for children five years old and younger.</p><p>Your child’s healthcare provider may refer you to Texas Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) if the child is younger than 3 years old. ECI helps families access resources and improve their child’s development through daily activities. Most services are provided in the home and are available statewide. You can learn more about ECI at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission’s website: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250311040642/https://www.hhs.texas.gov/services/disability/early-childhood-intervention-services\">hhs.texas.gov/services/disability/early-childhood-intervention-services</a>.

Since the program is time-limited, discharge planning must begin at the time of placement and should include the QRTP provider, child/youth’s family or subsequent caregiver support. Discharge planning must address post discharge aftercare services which will be for a minimum of 6 months.&nbsp;</p><p>The assessment process includes YFT’s initial QRTP clinical assessment, review and recommendations, subsequent YFT quality assurance reviews, and the CANS for every 90-day period. If at any point the assessment determines QRTP is no longer recommended, the QRTP provider initiates the discharge process, including submitting an appropriate discharge notice on DFPS Form K902-2109, in coordination with the child/youth’s family and casework team to prepare for the most appropriate placement to meet the child/youth’s needs in a less-restrictive environment within 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p>No later than the 3rd month of a QRTP placement for a child under 13 years old and no later than the 9th month of a youth between 13 – 18 years old, the QRTP provider and the child/youth’s casework team shall begin the discharge process.&nbsp;</p><p>Unplanned Discharges&nbsp;</p><p>When a child or youth is placed in a QRTP and provider has determined there is cause to discharge, provider must submit discharge notice with supporting documentation that will be reviewed by the Director or Associate Director of Placement Services, or their designee, for approval or denial of the discharge. The supporting documentation must include the following:</p><ul><li>Current Child Plan of Service</li><li>Therapist Recommendations</li><li>Therapy Notes (Last 90 days)</li><li>Incident Reports (Last 90 days)</li><li>Treatment Team Recommendations</li><li>Family Recommendations</li><li>Permanency Team Recommendations</li><li>Clinical Notes</li><li>Psychological (Current within 14 months)</li><li>Psychiatric Assessment, if applicable</li><li>Child Adolescent Needs &amp; Strengths (CANS) (within last 90 days)&nbsp;</li></ul><p>After submission and review of all information, Director or Associate Director of Placement Services, or their designee, has 2 business days to provide decision for approval or denial of the discharge and the timeframe for discharge provider has requested. If approved, discharge of child or youth will fall into the appropriate category for timeframes of discharge from residential placement as listed on the Residential Child Care Discharge Form <a href=\"http://intranet/application/Forms/showFile.aspx?NAME=K-902-2109.pdf\">Residential Child Care Discharge Form [<em>sic</em>, intranet link]</a>. If denied, provider must continue to provide placement and QRTP treatment services for the child.&nbsp;</p><p>Discharge planning information must be updated in the child/youth’s plan of service within 10 calendar days of any court hearings and provided to the court for review. The updated plan of service must include input given by the QRTP provider for family-based aftercare and support for a minimum of six months post discharge. At the time of physical discharge from the QRTP program a copy of the updated plan of service shall be given to all members of the child/youth’s casework team, including: caseworker, biological, adoptive, foster or kinship family members, supportive persons, next placement provider and legal parties.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Requesting Extension of a QRTP Placement&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All placements into a QRTP must be limited to specific time frames. If the child/youth has not stabilized within specified periods for their applicable age, the caseworker can request an extension. For a youth placed in a QRTP for more than 12 consecutive months or 18 non- consecutive months (if younger than 13 years old, this is reduced to 6-months), the caseworker shall submit documentation and information, including the qualified individual assessment information and court approval for continued QRTP placement through their chain of command to the QRTP Program Specialist by submitting the extension request packet to DFPSQRTP @dfps.texas.gov. The QRTP Program Specialist will then send to Associate Director of Placement to obtain final approval from the DFPS Commissioner.&nbsp;</p><p>To request an extension, the following steps must be completed at least 90 calendar days before the child/youth’s date of discharge from QRTP:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>The QRTP Program Specialist consults the child/youth’s treatment team, family, fictive kin and the caseworker to determine whether the child/youth requires additional time to stabilize.</li><li>If the child/youth’s treatment team determines that the child/youth is not ready to be discharged, the caseworker completes a waiver requesting an extension to allow the child/youth additional time to stabilize and indicates the length of extension being requested.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>To request a waiver, the caseworker must take the following actions:</p><ol><li>Complete <a href=\"http://intranet.dfps.txnet.state.tx.us/application/Forms/showFile.aspx?NAME=K-902-2354.docx\">QRTP Extension Wavier Request Form [<em>sic</em>, intranet link]</a>; then</li><li>Send the completed form and all supporting documentation, which must include a detailed statement from the Clinical or Treatment Director at the facility, to the CPS Program Administrator for approval; then&nbsp;</li><li>Program Administrator grants approval; then</li><li>Caseworker forwards the extension request and all supporting information and approvals to the QRTP Program Specialist by submitting the packet to DFPSQRTP @dfps.texas.gov ; then</li><li>If the QRTP Program Specialist approves the waiver request, the QRTP Program Specialist must forward it within one working day to the Associate Director of placement for approval; then</li><li>If the Associate Director of placement approves the extension request, the Associate Director for placement must forward the approved request to the Associate Commissioner.</li><li>CPS Associate Commissioner requests final approval to the DFPS Commissioner who will provide final approval/denial in writing.</li></ol><p>Page 34</p><p class=\"text-align-right\">&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>"

This type of group home allows three clients maximum in the home.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supported Home Living</strong> – This option is when a client lives in their family or own home. They could also be living in an adoptive home. Supported Home Living (SHL) involves having a staff coming into the home to assist with caregiving. SHL staff is able to take the client out of the home for outings in the community. SHL staff also comes into the home to assist with personal hygiene and other client- related activities. Families can be provided with Respite services only when using this option. Both Respite and SHL services can be Consumer Directed Services, meaning the family or the client hires and fires staff. &nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><p>The regional DDS can provide guidance in choosing the best option for a child based on the child’s specific needs.</p><p>Page 6</p>\n  </div>"

What would you want to know? What items would you want to be sure you could take with you? What or who would you feel sad about leaving behind? How would you want to be allowed to process or make the change?&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Support the move with community or other resources to the greatest extent possible. Does the child have luggage? Are there any local resources that can obtain luggage for the child, so he or she is not moving belongings in trash bags or other improvised means of transport? Can the Child Welfare Board support a going-away party to help provide closure for a child or youth leaving one community, set of friends, school?&nbsp;</li><li>Ask the child who he or she considers a connection. Help the child or youth figure out a plan to maintain connections to those people and things the child or youth desires. Does the child or youth have an address book? Is it updated? Does a youth have a cell phone with updated contact information? Or an email address book with updated contact information? Could there be some type of gathering to allow the child or youth time to say good-bye to friends, teachers and others, and reinforce the plan for continued contact?&nbsp;</li><li>Learn as much as possible about where the child is going. Read the home study. Which children are already placed or living there? Are there other people in the home besides the parents? Who are they?&nbsp;</li><li>Understand that the child is going to feel apprehensive and scared no matter where he or she is going. Regardless of any complaints a child may have had in a current placement, the child will still have to leave all the stability in that placement: routines, rules, friends, school schedule, school books, bus route, orientation to the location, sleeping arrangements, meals, caregivers, nearby connections, sports teams, church and church groups, other children in the current placement, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Don’t presume that because a child is related or connected to a caregiver that they know each other’s routines, habits, likes, dislikes, hobbies, religious beliefs, cultural practices, etc. Even if a child is returning to his or her parent, there will still be a period of re-acquaintance and readjustment.&nbsp;</li><li>Ask the child what would make him or her more comfortable in the move. If the child has to move again, ask the child what would make a placement better.&nbsp;</li><li>Remind the child the move is NOT THE CHILD’S FAULT.&nbsp;</li><li>Prep the new caregiver to the maximum extent possible. What are the child’s triggers, favorite foods, and least favorite foods? What are the child's hobbies? What does the child do for fun? What does the child want to be more comfortable in the home? What works and what does not work for the child? How does the child look when upset? What was the child’s role in the family of origin (e.g. is she the youngest and used to being the baby or is she the oldest and used to asserting control)? What is the child’s current daily schedule? Are there comfort items the child needs for sleep? If placing a baby, is the baby calmed by the use of a pacifier? Does the baby take a bottle or is the baby eating solid foods?</li></ul><p>This preparation should occur along with the pre-placement visit if at all possible.

They may maintain an ongoing relationship. The non-custodial parent may have a personal interest in the child, and more significantly, has a constitutionally protected interest in the parent’s relationship with the child (barring safety concerns about the non-custodial parent).</p><p>&nbsp;CPS should not recommend dismissal of its conservatorship case following placement with a noncustodial parent without first discussing it with the attorney representing the Department, as CPS must give consideration to the Department's requirement to make reasonable efforts to reunify the child with the parent from whom the child was removed. Rather, the Department should continue to work with both parents while reunification is the permanency goal for the case. For more information about permanency planning, see <a href=\"http://www.dfps.state.tx.us/handbooks/CPS/Files/CPS_pg_6200.asp#CPS_6200\">6200 [<em>sic</em>, broken link]</a> Permanency Planning and Case Planning in Substitute Care.&nbsp;</p><p>It is not necessary not appropriate to complete a home study on a non-custodial parent before placement. The caseworker should complete a CPS background and DPS criminal background check on all household members over the age of 14, conduct a home visit, and assess the parent's ability to meet the child's needs while providing a safe home. It is also important to remember that an absent parent did not necessarily know about the abuse and/or neglect and it is necessary to establish a safety reason to rule out placement, rather than making a determination based upon a personal bias or value about the absent parent's decisions or presence in the child's life.</p>\n  </div>"

Children are assessed when they initially come into care.&nbsp;</p><p>Although assessment is a broader function and relates to case planning overall, assessments are also critical in making placement choices. In particular, when children first come into care, and regularly thereafter, they are assessed during TX Health Steps checkups. The initial TX Health Steps checkup is due within 30 days of the child coming into foster care. These checkups can help identify any unnoticed medical, dental or related needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Child-care facilities and child-placing agencies have specific requirements in Minimum Standards related to assessment services, which are regulated services to determine the placement needs of a child in care. The caseworker should always continue close communication with the child-care facility or child- placing agency about the assessment services provided to a child in CPS conservatorship.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, as appropriate to an individual child, there may additional assessments, such as educational testing, psychological evaluations, service level determinations, and other professional assessments that may inform the placement choice.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Assess for Developmental or Intellectual Disability&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A child is assessed for intellectual and developmental disabilities by:</p><ul><li>TX Health Steps providers;</li><li>CPS caseworkers;</li><li>Developmental Disability Specialists; and</li><li>Other professionals and caregivers involved in the child’s life.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>Review Information from the Child’s Current Caregiver&nbsp;</h4><p>A contracted provider that initiates a placement change is required to complete and submit Form 2109 Residential Child Care Discharge Notice.
