Include spouse information if applicable;<br>• make sure to see the provider in person and be sure that the provider has the skills and physical capacity to care for the child;<br>• obtain the three signatures required: caregiver, caseworker and day care provider;<br>• attach needed documentation of employment and/or training:<br>– employment documentation may be a recent check stub or employer letter stating hours worked per week or tax forms for self-employed caregivers;<br>– training documentation can be a copy of your current class schedule or a letter from the school or training program; and<br>– disability documentation is a doctor’s letter detailing the extent of the disability if one parent is employed and one parent is disabled.</p><p>Keep copies of the application submitted, and all required documentation of employment or training. In case of loss or future questions, you will have what you need at your fingertips.</p><p>Your caseworker will determine if the potential day care provider is licensed to care for children according to guidelines for age and capacity. Unlicensed providers will have to have a CANTS background check.</p><p>Submit the completed application and all documentation to your regional DCFS Office Day Care Service Unit or the Office of Child Development (for Cook County cases) at 312-808-5060.</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>DCFS has bottom-line responsibility for providing for a child’s needs while in foster care. If you believe a child in your care needs something, ask the caseworker and the agency. If they agree, they will determine how to get it— from within the agency, from outside the agency, or from DCFS. If they don’t know how to get something for a child, it is their responsibility to ask DCFS for help.&nbsp;</p><p>Before requesting a one-time payment from DCFS, the caseworker and agency must consider:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>appropriateness of the request according to individual circumstances surrounding the child, the case, or the foster family;&nbsp;</li><li>DCFS’ contractual agreement with the agency;&nbsp;</li><li>other more appropriate sources of funding or services, such as from the school district or another state government department; and&nbsp;</li><li>DCFS policy.</li></ul><p>What DCFS will pay for and the circumstances under which DCFS will pay are given in DCFS Rule Section 359.7. Some of the major categories are explained in this section of the handbook.&nbsp;</p><p><em>All one-time payments from DCFS have a maximum allowable amount. </em>Caseworkers will request the appropriate amount based on individual case circumstances or funding available from other sources. Maximum allowable amounts of each type of payment mentioned in this section are not given because they are subject to change. The current allowable amounts may always be found in Appendix A of DCFS Procedure 359.7, which is public information. This procedure and all other DCFS policies, rules and procedures are available on the DCFS website at www. DCFS.illinois.gov.</p><h4>Questions About Payments</h4><p><strong>Private Agency Policy and Supports</strong> — Ask your child’s caseworker and the agency.</p><p><strong>DCFS Policy and Supports</strong> —Anyone with questions about DCFS payment policy or procedures may call the DCFS Advocacy Office for Children and Families at 800-232-3798. If your caseworker and agency and/or DCFS do not agree that the child needs the goods or services, you have the right to fi le a Service Appeal. (See Section 8, pages 26-28).</p><p><strong>Clothing&nbsp;</strong><br>The monthly licensed foster care payment includes funds to pay for a child’s clothing according to age, including school clothes and school uniforms and new clothing needed due to changes in season and normal growth. The caseworker/agency may request additional funds from DCFS for clothing under the following circumstances.</p><p><strong>Initial Placement: Clothing/Personal Hygiene Expenses&nbsp;</strong><br>When a child is placed, foster caregivers should review the child’s current clothing situation with the placing caseworker. Sometimes, when a child is removed from his home quickly, the caseworker will bring his clothes later. If the child has been in another foster home, all clothes, toys, personal hygiene items and belongings should be sent to the new foster home. If the child’s clothing appears inadequate, the caseworker may request an “initial clothing voucher” for a child in his first placement outside the home. <em>The initial clothing voucher may be requested at the time the case is opened or within 6 months of case opening</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>The child’s current wardrobe will be taken into account. Caregivers should be aware that there is a maximum, total amount allowable for the initial clothing voucher. If the child has moved more than once since initially coming into care, it could be that parts of the total amount may have been previously used in other placements. If the child has clothing needs, be sure to discuss this with the caseworker.</p><p><strong>Initial personal hygiene items </strong>may also be requested by the caseworker for a child in her first placement outside the home when the case is opened. Examples of necessary items are: toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush/comb/pick, deodorant, feminine hygiene items, baby bott les, diapers, baby powder, baby oil and other essential items. Not allowed: make-up, perfume, jewelry, hairdryers, etc. The intention is to take care of the child’s immediate, basic needs.</p><p><strong>Replacement Clothing&nbsp;</strong><br>Caregivers are expected to replace a child’s clothing using the monthly foster care payment. The caseworker/agency may request additional funds from DCFS for replacement clothing under these circumstances:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>a child whose clothes are unsuitable due to health or medical reasons, such as extraordinary weight gains or losses, excessive growth, or damage done to clothing to accommodate casts or braces;&nbsp;</li><li>destruction of clothing by fi re, flood, or the child’s willful destruction;&nbsp;</li><li>pregnant teens needing maternity clothes;&nbsp;</li><li>children who had been in a Department of Corrections (DOC) facility and are now returning to foster care; and&nbsp;</li><li>children who returned home for an extended period of time and then returned to foster care.</li></ul><p><strong>Notice to Caregivers Regarding Inadequate Clothing&nbsp;</strong><br>If the child’s caseworker feels that the child’s wardrobe is inadequate, he or she will talk with the caregiver and provide the caregiver with the concerns or needed actions in writing. The caregiver will have 30 days to obtain the needed items. Except for circumstances that qualify for a replacement clothing voucher (see above) clothing is to be purchased from the clothing allotment of the monthly board payment. If the caregiver doesn’t provide adequate wardrobe, the caseworker could request funds up to the allowed amount for replacement clothing. However, that amount could then be deducted from future monthly board payments. It is important to go through the child’s clothing and discuss it with the caseworker early in the placement. Details are in DCFS Procedure 359.75.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Summer Camp/Activities&nbsp;</strong><br>Caregivers whose licenses are supervised by a DCFS regional foster care program should be sure to discuss with the child’s caseworker the procedure for summer camps and other vital enrichment activities. These are important activities for a child’s overall development. Funding for camp, art and cultural activities is covered in Rule 359 Authorized Child Care Payments.</p><p>Caregivers for youth with open DCFS foster care cases should work with the child’s caseworker to:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>identify the right program;&nbsp;</li><li>confirm that the program is eligible for reimbursement under Rule 359;&nbsp;</li><li>obtain written approval;&nbsp;</li><li>pay for the camp in advance; and&nbsp;</li><li>submit the expense for reimbursement.</li></ul><p>Rule 359 caps annual camp expenses at $260.35. Other enrichment activities will be evaluated for the appropriate prevailing rate. The caseworker can assist with the approval and the reimbursement. Funding is always subject to the budget that is given to DCFS.</p><p><strong>Private Agency-Supervised Homes&nbsp;</strong><br>For private agency foster families, the policy can diff er from agency to agency. Every agency receives funds for “nonrecurring expenses” such as camp for some children. Ask the child’s caseworker about the camp policy for children at that agency.&nbsp;</p><h4>Graduation Expenses</h4><p><strong>DCFS-Supervised Homes&nbsp;</strong><br>For a student in DCFS foster care, policy covers payment for graduation expenses such as yearbook, pictures, cap and gown rental, class ring, new clothing for the graduation ceremony and other related fees.&nbsp;</p><p>The student must be in their junior or senior year for payment of the class ring. He or she must be in the senior year of high school to obtain payment for other graduation items. The total of all items purchased cannot exceed $512.50. As an example, if a youth wishes to purchase a class ring, the foster caregiver could submit the bill to the caseworker, who would then secure direct payment to the vendor.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Private-Agency Supervised Homes&nbsp;</strong><br>The specific procedures may diff er for families caring for children whose case management is assigned to a private agency. Private agencies receive an administrative fee per child to take into account such non-recurring expenses like graduation. The agencies are expected to purchase the approved items and not expect caregivers to cover the costs. Be sure to talk to the child’s caseworker in advance about what is allowable, especially before making any purchases out-of-pocket.&nbsp;</p><p>DCFS does not have any stated policy regarding expenses for eighth grade graduation. Be sure to talk to the youth’s caseworker if you have questions about those expenses.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Infant Equipment</strong><br>Sometimes, not having infant equipment can be a barrier to a caregiver taking the sibling of a child already in their home, or in taking an infant. A caseworker may request purchase authorization for a foster or relative home for infant <em>care equipment for a specific child age 2 and under.</em> The caregiver must sign the Infant Care Equipment Grant Application (DCFS Form: CFS 932C) and return a completed Infant Care List (DCFS Form: CFS 932D) for the appropriate items. The caregiver <em>must return the infant equipment to DCFS</em> if they stop providing infant care within one year of receiving the equipment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Family Reunification Special Service Fee</strong><br>The Family Reunification Special Service Fee is a reimbursement made directly to the caregiver for reunification activities to support a child with the permanency goal to return home. It is a reimbursement that can cover expenses such as transportation, entrance fees, and food that are part of activities supporting foster children and their parents. A caregiver who engages the parent in up to 12 activities in a month would result in a $400 reimbursement. Details on the qualifying activities are in Section 3, page 23.&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>caregivers to children with a return home goal should document all of the reunification activities that are eligible for reimbursement. Date and describe each activity;&nbsp;</li><li>the caregiver and the parent each sign the “log” on form CFS 1042-L as the event happens; and&nbsp;</li><li>at the end of the month the caseworker should review the document, sign it and obtain a supervisor signature.</li></ul><p><strong>Sibling Visits&nbsp;</strong><br>DCFS will reimburse foster families for transportation to sibling visits and compensate them for supervising short and overnight visits.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the plan, caregivers will receive reimbursement of up to $50 per month for mileage (56.5 cents per mile, as of January 2013), public transportation, bus or taxi. The special service fee must be requested by the caseworker and be approved according to the visitation plan developed for the child.&nbsp;</p><p>Caregivers who support sibling visitation by supervising visits may also request reimbursement through their caseworker at a rate of $25 per hour (excluding travel time) for a maximum of four hours ($100) each month. If the visit is overnight or longer, the caregivers may, once a month, be reimbursed $100 for the entire visit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>"

These reimbursements are less than those given to caregivers who are licensed. The standard-of-need rate varies according to the county of residence and the number of children in the home. Unlicensed caregivers are paid directly by the department even if a caregiver’s home is supervised by a private agency foster care program. These rates do change so unlicensed relative caregivers should always check with the Central Payment Unit (800-525-0499) for the most current rate.</p>\n  </div>"

Information contained in any licensing complaint is confidential and the identity of the person making the complaint will not be revealed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Within 2 Business Days of the Complaint&nbsp;</strong><br>The private agency caseworker (for homes supervised by an agency) or DCFS licensing staff &nbsp;(homes in a DCFS regional foster care program) within two business days must begin a licensing investigation with an<em> unannounced</em> visit to the foster home.</p><p><strong>Caregivers have the right </strong>to have a person of their choice with them during the licensing investigation to serve as a witness or advocate. If the person of choice is not present at that moment, caregivers may take at least four hours to have them present. The witness or advocate must agree to DCFS rules of confidentiality. Any person who is a witness or advocate will not be notified of the outcome of the licensing investigation.</p><p><strong>Within 30 Calendar Days of the Complaint&nbsp;</strong><br>The investigation should be completed within 30 calendar days of the complaint, but can be extended another 30 calendar days upon written notice to the caregiver.</p><p><strong>15 Days aft er Completing the Investigation&nbsp;</strong><br>DCFS or the private agency must make a formal determination of whether or not a licensing violation has occurred.</p><p><strong>5 Calendar Days aft er Determination&nbsp;</strong><br>DCFS or the private agency will send the caregivers being investigated a certified letter summarizing the findings of the licensing investigation.</p><p><strong>Caregivers Have the Right to Informal Review of the Decision&nbsp;</strong><br>If the caregiver disagrees with the licensing investigation decision, he or she may make a written request for an informal supervisory review of the decision within 10 days of the postmarked date of the letter. The licensing worker, the supervisor and the caregiver are required to attend this meeting. The caregiver may bring an attorney or representative to this meeting. Caregivers may share additional information at the meeting, which they believe to be relevant.</p><p>After the informal supervisory review, if the licensing decision is overturned, the process stops. If the decision is not overturned, there are several possible outcomes, and enforcement actions will proceed.</p><h4>Possible Outcomes of a Licensing Investigation</h4><p><strong>Corrective Action Plan&nbsp;</strong><br>If licensing violations are found and are correctable and the caregiver is willing and able to correct them in a short period of time, a written corrective action plan will be developed.</p><p>The written corrective action plan always contains:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>The written corrective action plan always contains:</li><li>a clear statement of what is expected in correcting them; and</li><li>a specified time frame for completion.</li></ul><p><strong>Post Complaint Monitoring Visit&nbsp;</strong><br>If the licensing investigation decision is not overturned, a time period for compliance to licensing standards is confirmed in writing to the caregivers. After the time period allowed, the licensing worker makes an <em>unannounced</em> visit to the foster family home to determine whether the licensing violations have been corrected.</p><p><strong>Caregiver Surrenders the License</strong>&nbsp;<br>During the investigation, the caregivers may decide to voluntarily surrender their license.</p><p><strong>Possible Enforcement Actions of Licensing Standards&nbsp;</strong><br>DCFS regions and agencies, in consultation with DCFS, are responsible for ensuring that licensing standards are met by the foster family homes under their supervision. DCFS issues all foster care licenses, even to private agency foster homes, and has <em>the final responsibility and authority</em> to enforce licensing standards.</p><p><strong>Enforcement actions are progressive and include</strong>:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>making a written assessment of the foster family’s compliance with licensing standards. The licensing worker must show that a “preponderance” of evidence exists to substantiate the violation;&nbsp;</li><li>consultation. The licensing worker must be able to show that he or she has attempted to work with the foster family in resolving any licensing issues or problems that were identified; and&nbsp;</li><li>documentation. Every contact leading up to any enforcement action must be recorded in the case file. Documentation includes information about the:<ul><li>seriousness of the violation;&nbsp;</li><li>substantial nature of the violation;&nbsp;</li><li>person or persons responsible for the violation;&nbsp;</li><li>ability to correct the licensing violation; &nbsp;</li><li>previous citations; &nbsp;</li><li>overall compliance; and &nbsp;</li><li>risk to children.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Negative Licensing Enforcement Actions&nbsp;</strong><br>If a prospective or current foster family has not been willing or able to comply with DCFS licensing standards, after reasonable steps have been taken to help them comply, negative enforcement actions are usually the result.</p><p><strong>Denial of an Initial License&nbsp;</strong><br>A foster care license may be denied if the prospective foster family:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>fails to complete the licensing process;&nbsp;</li><li>has a member of the household with a criminal history that prevents licensing;&nbsp;</li><li>home does not meet licensing standards, aft er reasonable attempts have been made to make corrections; or&nbsp;</li><li>has a member of the household with a serious/recent history of child abuse/neglect.</li></ul><p><strong>Changing/Reducing Capacity&nbsp;</strong><br>A corrective action plan determined by the caseworker and caregiver may be used to change the parameters of a license. The action commonly taken is to reduce the number of children a family may foster.</p><p><strong>Refusal to Renew A License&nbsp;</strong><br>Licenses may not be renewed if documented evidence exists that the health, safety, morals or welfare of children are in jeopardy. &nbsp;The licensing worker’s supervisor and the DCFS Licensing Administrator must approve this action. If this happens, the supervising agency will notify the caregivers by certified letter of the reasons the license is not being renewed and advising them that Central Office Licensing will formally notify them of their appeal rights.</p><p><strong>Revoking A License&nbsp;</strong><br>Licenses may be revoked if the health, safety, morals or welfare of the children are in jeopardy. The licensing worker, the supervisor, DCFS Licensing Administrator and DCFS Central Office of Licensing review the enforcement documentation and are involved in the decision to revoke a license. The foster parents will be notified by letter from DCFS of the decision to revoke their license and advising them of their rights.</p><p><strong>The “Conditional” License&nbsp;</strong><br>If serious licensing violations are found any time, the licensing worker may recommend revoking the foster parent/s’ original license and issuing a 6-month probationary license to allow the caregivers time to correct licensing violations if they indicate a willingness to do so. A corrective action plan is made which lists expectations and time frames for completion. At the beginning of the sixth month, a renewal study begins and the foster family home is expected to be in full compliance with licensing standards. If the foster family home is in full compliance, a full four-year license is issued. If not, revocation proceedings begin and an enforcement hearing is scheduled for the conditional license.</p><p><strong>Administrative Order of Closure&nbsp;</strong><br>The DCFS director is authorized by the Child Care Act, Section 11.2, to issue an order to immediately close a “licensed facility” whenever DCFS finds that continued operation jeopardizes the health, safety, morals or welfare of children. If applicable, the director is also authorized to initiate license revocation proceedings within 10 working days. An Administrative Order of Closure is signed by the DCFS director and <em>delivered in person by licensing staff</em> to the foster parent/s. Then, a letter citing all licensing violations and offering the opportunity for an informal review is sent to the foster parent/s within 10 working days. If the foster parents request a review within 10 days from the postmarked date of the DCFS letter, the review is <em>scheduled immediately</em>. If a review is not requested, the license revocation proceeds.</p><p><strong>Caregiver Rights Under Negative Enforcement Actions by DCFS&nbsp;</strong><br>Prior to revoking or refusing to renew a license, DCFS must notify the caregiver by registered mail. &nbsp;The DCFS letter contains information about how to request a hearing, if desired.</p><p><strong>10 Days from Postmark to Request Hearing&nbsp;</strong><br>The caregiver has 10 days from the postmarked date of the DCFS letter to make a written request for a hearing. The caregiver, in the same letter, may also request a written statement of the charges from DCFS. If the caregiver does not request a hearing within 10 days from the postmarked date of the DCFS letter, the license will be revoked or the renewal denied.</p><p><strong>Hearing within 30 Days of Postmark of Request/15 Day Notification of Hearing Date&nbsp;</strong><br>If the caregiver requests a hearing within 10 days from the postmark date time limit, the hearing date must be within 30 days of the postmark on the caregiver’s request lett er. DCFS must also notify the caregivers by registered mail at least 15 days in advance of the hearing date set. Both DCFS and the caregiver may subpoena witnesses and provide relevant documents for the hearing. A hearing officer will be appointed by DCFS. An attorney may represent the caregivers, if they choose to hire one. Aft er the hearing, DCFS will either determine whether to revoke or not renew the license, or will decide that no action should be taken.</p>\n  </div>"

You immediately report suspected abuse to the DCFS Hotline.</li><li>You may have information useful to the abuse/neglect investigation and be interviewed as a <em>collateral resource</em>; and<br>Example: An investigator contacts you about a report of neglect involving your neighbor’s son. As a neighbor, and with the boy being the best friend of your son and at your house daily, the investigator is looking for information you may have that will help in the investigation.</li><li><em>Monitor the safety and welfare of a child in an indicated report,</em> sharing information with the caseworker or making another report if there is a new incident.<br>Example: The eight year-old girl was sexually abused by an older child in the home. You and the caseworker work out a safety plan for the child and, as the caregiver, you monitor that it is being followed. You are also are responsible for calling the Hotline if you suspect any future abuse.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Caregivers can also find themselves in several other situations involving a child abuse/neglect investigation:</p><ol><li>a caregiver may be accused of abuse/neglect through a report called in to the DCFS Hotline and be investigated; or</li><li>a family member or a child living within the foster home may be the subject of an abuse/neglect investigation.</li></ol><h4>Talking to the DCFS Abuse/Neglect Hotline -- 800-25-ABUSE</h4><p><strong>Legal Requirements for All Mandated Reporters</strong></p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>suspected child abuse or neglect must be reported <em>immediately</em>;</li><li>privileged communication between professional and client is not grounds for failure to report. Willful failure to report suspected incidents of child abuse or neglect is a misdemeanor. Further, professionals may also be subject to penalties by their regulatory boards;</li><li>the mandated reporter may be required to testify regarding any incident reported, if the case becomes the subject of legal or judicial action;</li><li>state law protects the identity of all mandated reporters, who are given immunity from legal liability as a result of reports made in good faith; and</li><li>reports must be confirmed in writing to the local investigation unit<em> within 48 hours</em> of the Hotline call. Report forms may be obtained from the local DCFS office.</li></ul><p>The foster caregiver’s role as a mandated reporter is to inform the DCFS Abuse/ Neglect Hotline if you have reason to believe <em>that a child in your care </em>has been harmed or is in danger of being harmed — physically, or through neglect — and that another person either committed the harm or should have taken steps to protect the child from the harm.&nbsp;</p><p>An optional online mandated reporter training is available on the Virtual Training Center (VTC) at <a href=\"http://www.dcfstraining.org\">www.dcfstraining.org</a>.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><em>Foster caregivers are mandated reporters ONLY for children placed in their home or under their direct care and supervision. Caregivers are not legally mandated to report suspected abuse or neglect of other children, but as concerned citizens they should make a report.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>False Reporting to the Hotline&nbsp;</strong><br>Caregivers should be aware that it is a violation of Illinois law to intentionally make false reports of child abuse or neglect to the DCFS Hotline. Making false reports is a Class 4 Felony.</p><p><em>If a caregiver is the subject of an unfounded report and believes the report was made intentionally as an act of retaliation, he or she may make a request, in writing, within 10 days of the receipt of the DCFS notification letter, that the State Central Register (SCR) retain the report.&nbsp;</em></p><h4>Your Rights as a Mandated Reporter</h4><p><strong>Notification of the Finding&nbsp;</strong><br>After the investigation is completed, DCFS sends the mandated reporter a letter about what the investigation “found.” If the investigation found credible evidence of abuse or neglect, then the report is “indicated.” If credible evidence was not found, then the report is “unfounded.”</p><p><strong>Request A “Second Review” of the Case</strong><br>The notification letter also informs the mandated reporter of his or her right to request a second review of the investigation <em>within 10 days,</em> if he or she has any concerns about the adequacy of the investigation, and provides the address to send the written request.</p><p>DCFS has established multi-disciplinary review committees in each region of the State to do reviews requested by mandated reporters. Each committee is composed of a health care professional, a DCFS employee, a law enforcement official, a licensed social worker and a representative of the State’s Attorney’s Office. The Committee will review the case and make recommendations to the DCFS director as to the adequacy of the investigation and the accuracy of the final finding determination. All parties are notified of the director’s final decision.</p><h4>When Can DCFS Become Involved in Suspected Cases of Child Abuse or Neglect?</h4><p>Illinois law is quite clear about the circumstances under which DCFS can investigate and intervene when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected.</p><p><strong>All of following conditions must be present:</strong></p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>the victim must be less than 18 years of age;</li><li>the alleged perpetrator (person alleged to have committed the abuse/ neglect) must be a:<ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:square;\" type=\"square\"><li>parent;&nbsp;</li><li>stepparent;&nbsp;</li><li>paramour of the birth parent;&nbsp;</li><li>guardian;&nbsp;</li><li>foster caregiver;&nbsp;</li><li>immediate family member (siblings and grandparents, any person living in the home of the child);</li><li>person who came to know the child through an official capacity of position of trust (i.e. teacher, or health care professional, or volunteer in a youth program, etc.); or&nbsp;</li><li>person who is responsible for the welfare of the child (i.e. babysitter, day care facility or residential facility, etc.).&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>there must be a specific incident of abuse or neglect or a specific set of circumstances involving suspected abuse or neglect; and</li><li>there must be either demonstrated harm or a substantial risk of physical or sexual injury to the child.</li></ul><p><strong>Role of the DCFS Hotline Worker:&nbsp;</strong><br>The function of the DCFS Hotline worker is to determine whether or not the harm to the child described by the mandated reporter or other caller constitutes abuse or neglect under the State’s legal definition and can be investigated by DCFS. It is not the job of the Hotline worker to decide if the suspected abuse has actually occurred. All Hotline workers receive extensive, special training related to Illinois laws and what constitutes an abuse/neglect report.</p><p><strong>What Happens if a Report is Taken?&nbsp;</strong><br>If the Hotline worker takes your report, he or she will tell you and an investigation will begin within 24 hours. As a mandated reporter, you will be asked to supply a written confirmation of your verbal report within 48 hours. The local DCFS field office can provide the form (CANTS 4 or 5). This report may be used as evidence in any court proceeding that results from the incident.</p><p><strong>Local Child Protection Investigation (CPI) Unit Investigates Report&nbsp;</strong><br>An investigator will attempt to make contact with the reporter and then the child victim within 24 hours. If there is a possibility that the child is in immediate danger, the investigation begins immediately. The DCFS Child Protection Investigation Unit will investigate allegations of the circumstances listed below:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Abandonment/desertion&nbsp;</p><p>Bone fractures&nbsp;</p><p>Burns/Scalding&nbsp;</p><p>Cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions and oral injuries&nbsp;</p><p>Death&nbsp;</p><p>Diseases transmitted sexually Environment injurious to health and welfare&nbsp;</p><p>Environmental neglect&nbsp;</p><p>Failure to thrive&nbsp;</p><p>Head injuries&nbsp;</p><p>Human bites</p></td><td><p>Inadequate clothing&nbsp;</p><p>Inadequate food&nbsp;</p><p>Inadequate shelter&nbsp;</p><p>Inadequate supervision&nbsp;</p><p>Internal injuries&nbsp;</p><p>Lock-out&nbsp;</p><p>Malnutrition&nbsp;</p><p>Medical neglect&nbsp;</p><p>Medical neglect of disabled infants&nbsp;</p><p>Mental injury&nbsp;</p><p>Mental/emotional impairment</p></td><td><p>Poison/noxious substances</p><p>Sexual exploitation&nbsp;</p><p>Sexual molestation&nbsp;</p><p>Sexual penetration</p><p>Sexually transmitted diseases&nbsp;</p><p>Sprains, dislocations&nbsp;</p><p>Substance misuse&nbsp;</p><p>Substantial risk of physical injury</p><p>Substantial risk of sexual injury</p><p>Torture&nbsp;</p><p>Tying/close confinement</p><p>Wounds</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Initial Investigation: First 14 days</strong><br>In a small percentage of cases, the investigator may determine aft er the initial contact with the child that the abuse or neglect did not occur. The child protective service worker (CPSW) will verbally inform the mandated reporter and the alleged perpetrator of the abuse or neglect that the report was taken, but it is “unfounded” and the investigation is being discontinued. Or, after the initial contact, the CPSW may determine that the child is immediately safe, but further investigation is needed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Formal Investigation&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Completed within 60 days with one opportunity for a 30-day extension</strong><br>During the investigation, the CPSW will contact the victim, the mandated reporter, the alleged perpetrator, non-involved parents/caretakers, other adults living in the home, siblings and others who may have important information about the case. Investigators may also talk with other family members, potential witnesses or professionals to obtain additional, relevant information. Also, investigators will coordinate with police who may be conducting a related, but separate investigation. This happens when it is likely that the State’s Attorney will press criminal charges against the alleged perpetrator.</p><p><strong>Foster Caregiver as a Subject of an Abuse/Neglect Investigation&nbsp;</strong><br>Having an investigator arrive at your home and inform you that a Hotline report accusing you of child abuse or neglect has been made can be a very frightening experience. Investigators must handle the investigation of a foster caregiver in the same way they would anyone else.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Although investigations of foster caregivers must be treated the same as anyone else, every attempt is made to expedite the investigation (DCFS Procedure 300.70(b)).</strong> If you know you are innocent, try to remain calm and work through the investigation process. You have the following rights:</p><p><strong>RIGHT: To know the exact allegations made against you.&nbsp;</strong><br>The investigator must inform you of the allegations. Tip: Take notes while the investigator is informing you of the allegations. Read your notes back to the investigator to verify that you have them correctly noted.</p><p><strong>RIGHT: To know the circumstances surrounding the allegation/s.&nbsp;</strong><br>The circumstances include the “what,” “where,” and “when” information surrounding the report. For example, the circumstances of the abuse allegations are that you were seen in the backyard beating a six-year-old child with a belt about 2 p.m. today. You will not be given the name of the person who called in the report to the Hotline — all reporters must remain confidential.</p><p><strong>RIGHT: To off er names of people (collaterals) who will substantiate your story.&nbsp;</strong><br>Many investigations can be dealt with quickly. Once you know what the allegations are against you, you can decide how to proceed. Maybe, it is just a misunderstanding and can be cleared up quickly by offering facts and the names of others who can verify what you tell the investigator.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Questioning of Children&nbsp;</strong><br>The investigator must see the child or children alleged to have been abused or neglected within 24 hours of the report to the DCFS Hotline, or sooner to determine whether they are safe and not in immediate danger. Sometimes, the CPSW will go to the school to question the child before you are even aware of the allegations. If the child lives with you, the CPSW may question the child while in your home.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RIGHT: To call someone for advice prior to questioning.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To have an attorney or representative present during questioning.&nbsp;</strong><br>Sometimes, the allegations and situation are not simple. Aft er hearing the allegations, you may want or need advice on how to proceed. You have the right to call someone for advice before being questioned by the investigator. You also have the right to secure an attorney to be present during questioning, if you can do so within <em>24 hours</em>. You also have a right to have a personal representative or witness of your choosing present with you during questioning, <em>if they can be present within four hours and will sign an Acknowledgment of Non-Disclosure form (CANTS 23).</em></p><p>Remember: the CPSW is aware of your rights. Exercising your rights is not an indication of guilt, but a matt er of self-protection.</p><h4>Removal of Children from a Foster Home</h4><p><strong>Your Own Children: Birth or Adopted Children&nbsp;</strong><br>Caregivers who are under investigation for abuse or neglect have the same rights as any other parents: to be notified of and to appear at the Temporary Custody Hearing within 48 hours of the removal of their children.</p><p><strong>Children in Foster Care&nbsp;</strong><br>The CPSW has the right to remove children in foster care from a foster home without giving advance notice if he or she believes the child is in imminent risk of harm.</p><p><strong>What Happens as a Result of an Abuse/Neglect Investigation?&nbsp;</strong><br>The CPSW gathers information during the investigation about the specific allegation/s of harm to the child. At the end of that process, the CPSW must decide if the report is “indicated” or “unfounded.” The standard of proof is “credible evidence,” a lower standard than that required for any court procedure. The lower standard of proof allows DCFS to serve families and protect children in many situations that could not be proven using the higher law enforcement or judicial standards. DCFS can indicate the report if the CPSW finds that there is credible evidence that the perpetrator committed the abuse or neglect. If credible evidence cannot be documented, the report will be <em>unfounded</em>.</p><p><strong>“Indicated” Finding&nbsp;</strong><br>Indicated reports showing credible evidence that abuse or neglect occurred have these possible outcomes:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>abused or neglected child is unsafe and is removed from home;</li><li>abused or neglected child and other children living in the home are unsafe and are removed from home;&nbsp;</li><li>children are not removed from home because they are not currently at risk, for example, the perpetrator of abuse no longer lives in the home;&nbsp;</li><li>criminal charges are recommended; or&nbsp;</li><li>services are provided for the child/ren and family.</li></ul><p><strong>“Unfounded” Finding&nbsp;</strong><br>These situations can lead to an unfounded finding:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>it is impossible to <em>document </em>credible evidence of abuse or neglect from the facts; or&nbsp;</li><li>no credible evidence exists that abuse or neglect occurred.</li></ul><p><strong>Concurrent Investigations&nbsp;</strong><br>An allegation charging a licensed caregiver of abuse or neglect will also result in a licensing complaint investigation. Formerly the licensing investigation took place aft er the CPSW investigation was completed. However, to minimize the impact of two investigations on the foster family and to make the process more effective, DCFS recently established a policy for concurrent investigations. While the licensing investigator and CPSW are not required to conduct all investigative activities together, such cooperation is encouraged. Both the CPSW and the licensing investigator will jointly plan their respective investigations and exchange investigative information weekly.</p><p>Once the CPSW and the licensing complaint investigations are completed, based on the findings, the local DCFS or private agency child welfare team will be responsible for monitoring the protective plan, developing a corrective plan (if needed) and additional follow-up casework.&nbsp;</p><h4>Rights of Subjects of Child Abuse and/or Neglect Investigations After the Investigation</h4><p>Notification of the Finding Anyone who has been the subject of an investigation has the right to receive written notification of the finding (indicated or unfounded) from DCFS, who must mail the notification within 10 calendar days aft er the final determination has been entered into the State Central Register (SCR). <em>If the report is unfounded, DCFS must also send written notification to all persons interviewed during the investigation informing them that the report was unfounded. This is only done with the consent of the adult subject of the investigation.</em></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Record Retention&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The State Central Register (SCR) retains records of indicated findings for a minimum of 5 years and longer for indicated findings of serious child abuse or neglect. A complete listing of the SCR record retention policy for f i les of indicated cases is in DCFS Procedure 300, Appendix B.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Request SCR Keep “Unfounded” File to Substantiate False Reporting&nbsp;</strong><br>Anyone who feels he or she may be the victim of individuals calling in false reports to the DCFS Hotline may request DCFS keep the fi le in case evidence of harassment is needed at a later date. This written request must be made to DCFS <em>within 10 days</em> of receipt of the DCFS notification letter. All identifying information about any unfounded report involving the death of a child, the sexual abuse of a child or serious physical injury to a child shall be retained in the State Central Register for three years from the date the final finding report is entered into the SCR. DCFS automatically retains unfounded reports of physical injury called in by mandated reporters for 12 months as possible background and history for investigators if future reports are made. Other unfounded reports must be removed from the SCR aft er 30 days.</p><p><strong>Copy of the Investigation File&nbsp;</strong><br>The DCFS notification letter informs the subject how and where to request a copy of the fi le of the investigation. Any information that could identify the reporter will be deleted from the file.</p><p><strong>Return of Children to the Foster Home&nbsp;</strong><br>The caseworker has the responsibility of deciding whether or not it is in the child’s best interest to be returned to your foster home, based on the facts of the investigation, the CPSW’s indicated or unfounded finding, and any other issues, such as a pending licensing complaint. If you do not agree with the caseworker’s decision, go up the chain of command to the supervisor and administrator. You also may have the right to appeal to DCFS, depending on the facts of your case. If you need help determining your appeal rights in having the children returned, call the DCFS Advocacy Office for Children and Families at 800-232-3798.</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <h4>Emergency Review&nbsp;<br>Within 10 calendar days from the date of your initial appeal&nbsp;</h4><p>Sometimes DCFS or an agency takes an action without telling you before they do it. Usually this happens if the agency or DCFS believes a child to be either at imminent risk of harm if action is not taken immediately.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If this happens, foster caregivers have the right to request an Emergency Review to stop the agency or DCFS from taking action that involves a change in placement of the child.</strong></p><p>An Emergency Review allows DCFS to make a temporary decision based on a concern that the child will be in “imminent risk of harm” while the case is proceeding through the service appeal process. Foster caregivers, DCFS or a provider agency can request an Emergency Review.</p><p>To request an Emergency Review, <em>send a written request within 10 calendar days of the date on the notice of decision or the date the action was taken</em> to the same address as shown on page 26 for fi ling a service appeal.</p><h4>What Information to Include in Your Appeal Letter</h4><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li><strong>information about you</strong>: name, address, phone (days and evenings);&nbsp;</li><li>agency name or DCFS region;&nbsp;</li><li>child/ren’s name/s, ID numbers and dates of birth;&nbsp;</li><li>caseworkers name and phone number;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>your request: </strong>ask for mediation, fair hearing and/or emergency review or ask for help in deciding what to request; and&nbsp;</li><li><strong>briefly list the issues</strong>: The DCFS staff person receiving your appeal letter needs a short summary to be able to respond to your request quickly. Rambling letters and volumes of pages are unnecessary and will slow the process. Just number and list the decisions and issues. For example: 1) Child was never returned to my home aft er I was found innocent of child abuse. 2) Service plan says child is to have counseling. Counseling has never been approved.</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Attach: </strong>Copies of any previous DCFS or agency written notice/s of decision.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do not attach: </strong>“Evidence,” such as service plan copies, receipts or case chronologies. Keep these for later use</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Mediation: An Optional, Informal Way to Resolve Disputes<br>Within 30 calendar days of date of appeal</h4><p>After a caregiver sends in an appeal letter or fax, the Administrative Hearing Unit will reply by letter, asking if he or she would like to participate in mediation to try to solve the issues before a formal fair hearing.&nbsp;</p><p>Mediation is an <em>informal</em> process where the caregiver and the staff responsible for the decision discuss differences with a neutral third party (a trained mediator) leading the discussion. The caregiver has 15 days after mediation to accept or reject the mediation agreement. Mediation gives all parties in the decision-making process a chance to express their point-of view, take part in the decision-making process and be a part of the final decision.</p><p>If agreement is reached in mediation, all parties sign a Memorandum of Agreement which lists the terms of the agreement. Mediation services resolve the majority of the issues coming to DCFS for appeal. Using mediation services is optional. Caregivers may request a Fair Hearing instead, or at any time during the mediation process. The agreement is not a legally binding contract.&nbsp;</p><h4>Fair Hearing: A Formal Process&nbsp;<br>Within 45 calendar days of the filing date of appeal&nbsp;</h4><p>An impartial Administrative Law Judge is appointed by DCFS to preside over the Fair Hearing, which is a<em> formal process</em> in which records of the proceedings are kept. Legal rules of evidence are generally followed.&nbsp;</p><p>During the Fair Hearing both the caregiver and other parties have the right to:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>examine the other side’s evidence;&nbsp;</li><li>present and question witnesses;&nbsp;</li><li>present any information relevant to the issues;&nbsp;</li><li>question or disprove any information, including an opportunity to &nbsp;question opposing witnesses; and&nbsp;</li><li>mutually agree to a resolution of any issue in dispute.</li></ul><p>DCFS will almost always be represented by an attorney. The caseworker and other staff involved in your case may not be present unless you or the DCFS attorney calls them as witnesses.&nbsp;</p><p>During this formal process, the administrative law judge conducts the hearing in many ways that are similar to hearings in court. Foster caregivers are not required to have an attorney representing them at the Fair Hearing. However, they must understand that if they decide to present their own argument, they will be facing a licensed attorney and they must follow the rules of evidence set out for administrative proceedings such as service appeals.</p><p>Foster caregivers who are unable to secure an attorney to represent them may wish to consider going to mediation instead of going immediately to a Fair Hearing, because mediation is an informal process where caregivers can discuss their concerns with involved staff under the guidance of a trained mediator.</p><p>If agreement is reached, the case is dismissed. If mutual agreement is not reached, the Administrative Law Judge will recommend to the DCFS director how the issue should be resolved.</p><h4>Final DCFS Decision&nbsp;<br>Within 90 days from the filing date of the appeal&nbsp;</h4><p>The DCFS director will consider the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation and issue DCFS’ final decision on the issue.</p><p>DCFS must make and act upon its final administrative decision within 90 days from the date the service appeal was filed, unless a delay in this time frame is caused or agreed to by the person appealing.</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>Generally, personal information and records about children and their families may not be given to others unless an individual 18 years old or older gives written consent, or the parent or guardian of someone under 18 gives written consent. Based on frequently asked questions about confidentiality and the responsibility of caregivers, the following guidelines can help you to determine what can and cannot be shared and in what context.</p><h4>Support Groups</h4><p>Participants in special support groups such as “Mothers of Children with ADD” come together to give and receive support. Sharing information outside the group is not supportive. Principles of confidentiality should be stated at the beginning of each session. Participants must agree not to repeat, outside of the meeting, any information about a specific child, the family, or the foster family.</p><p><em>Any violation of confidentiality is a violation of licensing standards and is an issue the support group needs to deal with.</em></p><h4>Training</h4><p>It is appropriate to share information in general terms without identifying the child or supplying identifying information.</p><h4>Other Foster Caregivers or Relatives&nbsp;</h4><p>Sharing of information about children or their families with other caregivers or relatives, who have no need to know about why the child is in foster care, is a violation of confidentiality. Seeking help from other caregivers on handling behavioral issues is appropriate, but sensitive, and information should not be shared with third parties.</p><h4>School Personnel</h4><p>The school and teacher need to know the child is in foster care due to the contacts required by the caseworker, your relationship with the child as the foster caregiver and the application for free lunch, textbooks and fees. The teacher and everyone else at the school do not need to know the details of the case and personal information about the child and birth family. Prior school records, including special education, will be available for school personnel to use to help guide the child academically. If the teacher wants more information, get the caseworker’s opinion of what the teacher needs to know, or ask the caseworker to respond to the teacher’s request.</p><h4>Babysitters/Respite Providers</h4><p>If another caregiver, relative, or other person provides babysitting or respite, consult with the caseworker about information you feel is necessary to share for them to adequately take care of the child. The extent of information shared for a temporary or respite placement may vary, depending on the length of time, frequency, status of the respite provider, needs of the child and based on a “need to know.”</p><h4>Press Protocol—Dealing with the Media</h4><p>Caregivers may be interested in positive press coverage about foster care, but need to make sure it happens within the parameters of the state’s confidentiality laws. The DCFS Communications Office can help decipher confidentiality laws for anyone seeking local press coverage for agency or foster parent support group events, or whether a newspaper wants to feature a child or foster family. Some general rules to keep in mind follow. But the easy way for any caregiver in dealing with the media is to refer them to DCFS Communications at 312- 814-6847. If it is a good opportunity, DCFS Communications will make sure it happens, and will work with you to make sure the child’s confidentiality is maintained. <strong>All press inquiries MUST be immediately directed to the Communications Office at 312-814-6847.</strong></p><h4>Interviews:</h4><p>All requests for interviews or to publish photos of a child in foster care - whether by a newspaper, other media outlet, or for other use such as agency promotional materials - must have prior approval of the Communications Office at 312-814-6847.</p><p>• a child in foster care may not be interviewed nor have any photos of him or her published in an agency annual report, or any document or publication which would be used as a marketing tool;<br>• children 14 years old or older can be interviewed with the written consent of both the child and the DCFS Guardian if the caseworker agrees that the interview is in the best interest of the child; and<br>• these people MUST be present for an interview at a foster home: representative from the Communications Office; the caseworker and foster caregivers; the director of the private agency, or his designee, if possible.</p><h4>Photos</h4><p>• the child’s image cannot be shown, unless there has been a termination of parental rights (TPR);<br>• a general group setting is permissible, if parental rights have been terminated; and<br>• a child under 14 may NOT be identified as a child in foster care, unless the situation involves a recognition or honor of the child, then the child can be identified as being in foster care, IF it is relevant or significant to the honor, AND with permission of the child, the DCFS Guardian and the Communications Office.</p><h4>Parties</h4><p>• if the party is sponsored by an organization which wants the press present, they MUST notify the Communications Office and DCFS Guardian in advance; and<br>• photos are allowed, if approved in advance by DCFS, and are photos of children whose parental rights have been terminated.</p><h4>Consents</h4><p>• must be obtained in writing from the DCFS Guardian’s office;<br>• may only be authorized by the Guardian or the DCFS Consent Unit. No authorized agents can consent; and<br>• after the Guardian has given consent, the interview or contact must be coordinated with the DCFS Communications Office.</p><h4>Planning or Treatment Teams</h4><p>After discussing with the caseworker what can be shared with other service providers, it is appropriate for caregivers to share major life occurrences, such as termination of parental rights or adoption as the case plan, or visitation details with teachers, doctors, respite providers, etc. as members of the team to benefit the child. Often, these occurrences have an impact on the child’s behavior and feelings and the team members can help the child cope if they are aware of specific circumstances. It is not appropriate to share this information without clearing it first with the caseworker.</p><h4>Sharing Permanency Plans</h4><p>After adoption has become the goal and parental rights have been terminated, sharing of the permanency plan is appropriate only on a “need to know” basis as approved by the caseworker. Sharing of the permanency plan for the child with other foster family members or friends is only appropriate when the plan is clear and the caseworker and foster parents decide that sharing would not violate the child’s rights to confidentiality and would benefit the child. You should not discuss specific placement of a child or attempt to arrange placement of a child on your own.</p><h4>HIV Status and Testing Confidentiality and Consents</h4><p>See Section 5; Health Services, page 37-39.</p><h4>Sexually Problematic Behavior Confidentiality and Consents</h4><p>See Section 5; Health Services, page 28.</p><h4>Disagreements About Confidentiality</h4><p>If a caregiver and caseworker disagree about maintaining confidentiality, the caseworker’s supervisor needs to be involved. For example, an adoptive family has been selected and the caseworker has asked the foster family not to share this with the child yet, but the foster family feels that the child knowing will relieve his or her fears of never having a permanent family. The agency and DCFS have the final decision, but caregivers can appeal their decision to agency administration or through the DCFS Appeal System. (See pages 26-28)</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <h4>Do Foster Caregivers Have A Legal Relationship or Responsibility for Children Foster Care?</h4><p>No. DCFS is legally responsible for all children while they are in foster care. The extent of DCFS’ legal authority depends on what the court has ordered. If a caregiver adopts a child or becomes a child’s legal guardian when the child leaves foster care, then the caregiver assumes legal responsibility for the child as the adoptive parent or guardian. See Section 7.</p><h4>Do Foster Caregivers Have to Use the Child’s Legal Name?</h4><p>Yes. The name that appears on the child’s birth certificate is the name to be used for school and all other legal purposes, such as bank accounts and medical records. If you have questions about the child’s legal name, ask the caseworker.</p><h4>What Happens if a Caregiver is Sued?</h4><p>If caregivers are sued as a result of their activities as a foster caregiver, they may ask that the Illinois Attorney General represent them in court. To request legal representation, foster parents should ask the child’s caseworker to forward their request. The caseworker will forward a written request to the Regional DCFS Counsel within three working days. The DCFS Regional Counsel will then consult with his or her supervisor before forwarding the request to the Attorney General. Legal representation in lawsuits against an individual for matters unrelated to foster parenting is the responsibility of the individual. Legal representation by the Attorney General is not guaranteed.</p><h4>What Can Foster Caregivers Sign on Behalf of Their Foster Children?&nbsp;</h4><p>Foster caregivers make dozens of daily decisions related to the care, safety and well-being of the children placed with them. They are asked to sign field trip slips and to give permission to go to slumber parties. However, these routine, day-to-day parenting decisions are different from giving consent. The term consent involves signing a formal, legally binding document, after an informed, deliberative process. Caregivers do not have the authority to give consent on behalf of foster children. The DCFS guardian or designee and the child’s birth parents (depending on the authority given by the Juvenile Court and/or the nature of the consent) can be consenting parties.</p><p>Still, in the foster care role, there will be many instances when an adult signature is requested for an activity or a service. The charts included on pages 17-19 designate instances when they can make a decision or approve participation and when a foster caregiver must ask the caseworker to request approval or consent from the DCFS Guardian’s office.</p><h4>What if a child is arrested for a crime?</h4><p>When a child who is under state care is arrested or charged for an alleged crime, the case will not be handled by the Child Protection Division of the Court, which deals with matters of child abuse and neglect. Instead, this matter would be handled by the Juvenile Justice Division or Criminal Division, depending on the age of the child and the charge.</p><p>If a youth is brought in for questioning or arrested in a criminal or juvenile justice matter, the foster caregiver should notify the caseworker immediately. Give as much information to the caseworker about the circumstances of the questioning or arrest, such as where the youth is being held, the alleged charge and any pending court dates.</p><p>Caregivers may choose to be a source of support for the youth during the proceedings. For example, you may decide to attend court hearings or restorative justice proceedings, make visits if he or she is held in custody or even post bond on behalf of the child. However, since foster parents are not legal guardians, they have no obligation to participate in any proceeding. Therefore, it is important that the caseworker be kept apprised of all developments. The caseworker will contact the DCFS Office of Legal Services or the DCFS Guardian’s office, as appropriate.</p>\n  </div>"

Example: Caregivers with skills or the desire to foster medically complex children might decide to transfer to an agency with a specific foster care program for medically complex children; or<br>• they are extremely dissatisfied with their current agency’s service, support, or foster care program, and feel they have exhausted avenues of complaint within their current supervising agency or DCFS region.&nbsp;</p><p>An agency or DCFS region is not required to accept the transfer of a foster parent license, but will be more likely to consider accepting the transfer if:<br>• the caregiver is in good standing with the current supervising agency or DCFS region;<br>• caregiver’s skills and interests match the needs of children within the foster care program/s;<br>• there is not a pending licensing investigation or a licensing corrective action plan in place;<br>• the foster family does not have children currently placed with them; or<br>• adoption of children currently placed with the foster family is not pending.</p><p>If the new agency or DCFS region decides to accept the transfer, the new agency will:<br>• ask the caregiver to sign a form authorizing their current agency to release their fi le to the new agency;<br>• send the signed consent form to the current agency with a letter requesting the foster family file; and<br>• submit the transfer to DCFS for approval</p><h4>Automatic Transfer of License by DCFS</h4><p>DCFS monitors the performance and quality of services provided by all contracted private child welfare agencies. If an agency’s services do not meet DCFS quality standards, DCFS has the right to cancel the agency’s contract. If this happens, foster families supervised by the agency will receive a letter from DCFS explaining that the agency’s contract has been cancelled and naming the new agency responsible for the supervision of the foster family and the children placed with them. In this case, DCFS will automatically transfer the foster care license to the new supervising agency and the new agency will contact the foster family.</p><p>Caregivers should expect the new agency to visit them to:<br>• welcome and orient them to the new agency’s policies and procedures; and<br>• ensure licensing standards are being followed.</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Licenses are not to be transferred during the licensing renewal process (6 months prior to expiration) unless prior approval is received by the agency from DCFS’ Central Office of Licensing.</p>\n  </div>"

New foster families are told about this visit during the initial licensing process, so, although it is unannounced, it should not be a surprise.</p><p>During this visit, licensing staff verifies that:<br>• the number of children in the home matches licensing capacity;<br>• the ages of children cared for matches licensing standards;<br>• children’s records are being maintained;<br>• space within the home is being used as planned and licensed;<br>• unsafe conditions do not exist;<br>• there have been no changes to the physical environment;<br>• discipline problems do not seem to exist; and<br>• there are no persons living in the home not accounted for in the record.</p><h4>Bi-Annual Monitoring Visit</h4><p>Licensing staff will make an unannounced visit every six months for three years after the license is issued. Discussion at the annual monitoring visit will be about:<br>• provisions of the license;<br>• supervision of the children;<br>• evacuation plans, in case of emergency;<br>• changes since the previous visit;<br>• discipline techniques;<br>• nutrition plans;<br>• foster caregiver responsibility as a mandated reporter for children placed<br>in the home;<br>• safety issues;<br>• sleeping arrangements; and<br>• support services.</p><h4>License Renewal Visit</h4><h4>5½ Months Prior to License Expiration</h4><p>Licensed caregivers will receive a letter from DCFS Central Office of Licensing indicating the expiration date of their license and instructions to complete the enclosed renewal application and to contact their licensing representative. The caregivers should immediately contact their licensing representative to begin the renewal process.</p><p>Visits to renew the foster care license are conducted by appointment. During the renewal visit, the licensing representative will check that all licensing standards are met. It may feel like an initial licensing visit, but, it is also a good opportunity to discuss experiences and ask questions.&nbsp;</p><p>After the renewal visit, the licensing representative may recommend to:<br>• renew the foster care license;<br>• issue a 6-month conditional license until the home can come into compliance with licensing standards. Conditional licenses cannot be renewed as conditional; or<br>• not renew the license and not issue a conditional license.</p><h4>“As Needed” Visits</h4><p>Unannounced visits are made “as needed” to check that the family and their home meets licensing standards. “As needed” visits are used if a foster family has established a pattern of not meeting licensing standards. The frequency of these visits is determined by the foster family’s ability to come into, and remain, in compliance with licensing standards.</p><p><strong>Tip from Experienced Caregivers:</strong> If you don’t understand why licensing staff is visiting, just ask. If the answer is difficult to understand, or visits seem too frequent or unnecessary, talk to the supervisor and your agency or DCFS regional administration for clarification. Put your questions and concerns in writing</p>\n  </div>"

Short title. This Article may be cited as the Foster Parent Law.<br>(Source: P.A. 89-19, eff. 6-3-95.)</p><p>(20 ILCS 520/1-5)<br>Sec. 1-5. Legislative findings. Family foster care is an essential service for children and their families who have been separated due to the tragedy of child abuse, neglect, or dependency. When children have been separated from their families, it is the responsibility of the child welfare team to respond to the needs of the children and their families<br>by means including (i) providing protection and nurture to children in a safe, healthy environment; (ii) meeting the developmental and emotional needs of the children, including maintaining and promoting a child’s emotional attachment to his or her own family; (iii) protecting and promoting the child’s cultural identity and heritage; and (iv) working toward permanency for children by connecting them to safe, nurturing relationships intended to last a lifetime, preferably with their own family.&nbsp;</p><p>Foster parents are an essential part of and fulfill an integral role on the child welfare team along with children in care who are old enough to participate in planning and services, parents of children in care, caseworkers, and other professionals serving the child and family. By providing care for children and supporting the attachment of children to their families in a manner sensitive to each child’s and family’s unique needs, the foster parent serves the child, the family, and the community.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to successfully fulfill their role on the professional child welfare team, foster parents must be committed to the goal of the child welfare program and must provide care to children and promote the best interests of the children and families served. In order to achieve this goal, foster parents must understand and be sensitive to issues of culture, ethnicity, religion, and children’s connectedness with their families and must maintain a level of care, conduct, and demeanor that is consistent with the high professional ethics demanded of all other members of the child welfare team.</p><p>The General Assembly finds that there is a need to establish public policy regarding the role of foster parents. The General Assembly establishes this statement of foster parents’ rights and responsibilities, which shall apply to all foster parents in the State of Illinois, whether supervised by the Department of Children and Family Services or by another agency under contract to the Department of Children and Family Services to provide foster care services.<br>(Source: P.A. 89-19, eff. 6-3-95.)</p><p>(20 ILCS 520/1-10)<br>Sec. 1-10.

There are two parts to Youth Housing Assistance: Housing Advocacy and Cash Assistance, each of which is explained below. Often a client will need housing advocacy services first. Once housing is identified, that same client often needs cash assistance. Other clients will not need housing advocacy at all and will simply utilize cash assistance. Still others just need help finding housing and do not need any cash assistance. Call for details.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Housing Advocacy:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Housing advocacy services assist young adults in obtaining and/or maintaining stable housing. Services include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>assistance in securing affordable housing;&nbsp;</li><li>consumer education;&nbsp;</li><li>budget counseling; &nbsp;</li><li>linkages to community based resources (i.e. assistance with utilities, clothing and food); and&nbsp;</li><li>follow-up services for a minimum of three months after the client secures appropriate housing.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Note: Housing Advocacy does not include any money.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eligibility Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Youth receiving housing advocacy services must meet all three of the following criteria:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>be at least 17 ½ and less than 21 years of age;&nbsp;</li><li>be the legal responsibility of DCFS within six months of case closure, or have aged out of DCFS care; (Note: Youth that entered adoption or subsidized guardianship after their 14th birthday are also eligible.); and&nbsp;</li><li>have an income that is sufficient to meet rent and utility costs; or be working to obtain that income. (While housing advocacy can begin before income is in place, it is extremely unlikely that youth will be able to secure housing without sufficient income. Housing advocates can often help with employment.)</li></ol><p><strong>Cash Assistance:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Assistance will vary depending on a client’s situation. Cash assistance may be authorized for the following reasons:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>housing security deposit;&nbsp;</li><li>rent (limited circumstances);&nbsp;</li><li>beds for the client and the client’s children;&nbsp;</li><li>current utility bills or utility deposits;&nbsp;</li><li>appliances;&nbsp;</li><li>partial housing subsidy for a period of one year following case closure (housing costs must exceed 30% of income and assistance cannot continue past the client’s 21st birthday); and&nbsp;</li><li>items required by the client to avoid or manage a crisis.</li></ul><p><strong>Eligibility Requirements:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Youth receiving Cash Assistance must meet all four of the following criteria:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>be at least 18 and less than 21 years of age;&nbsp;</li><li>be legally the responsibility of DCFS and ready for case closure or have aged out of DCFS care (Note: Youth that moved to adoption or subsidized guardianship are NOT eligible for cash assistance); &nbsp;</li><li>have completed a budget statement (Form CFS 370-5C) that demonstrates that with any subsidy and all other income they will be able to cover all remaining living expenses (e.g. housing, utilities, clothing, food); and&nbsp;</li><li>need cash assistance in order to attain or maintain stable housing.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Referral Process or Questions: Please discuss this program with your caseworker. For more information, caseworkers may contact the Youth Housing Assistance Coordinator at 312-814-5571.</p><p><strong>Supervised Independent Living Program (SILP)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This program provides supportive services and living maintenance to youth. SILP is offered through private agencies contracted by DCFS to provide services. These agencies provide services such as various types of advocacy, training, counseling and monitoring services.&nbsp;</p><p>Youth who participate in this program must be:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>age 16 and older, but not yet 21; and&nbsp;</li><li>under DCFS’ guardianship. and they must:&nbsp;</li><li>have a permanency goal of “27” in accordance with Administrative Procedures #5;&nbsp;</li><li>have some money management skills;&nbsp;</li><li>be able to live in the community without continuous adult supervision;&nbsp;</li><li>have the desire and ability to cooperate with the supervising agency and their program rules; and&nbsp;</li><li>be able to manage day to day living skills in an apartment or room and board arrangement such as meal preparation, purchasing and maintaining clothing and keeping themselves and their living environment reasonably clean.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Other requirements and policy governing the Supervised Independent Living Program are in DCFS Rule and Procedures, Subpart C – Appendix H - P302.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Medical Coverage after DCFS Care&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The medical card that youth receive while in foster care makes it possible to take care of a wide range of routine and critical medical needs. When a child’s case closes aft er they leave DCFS foster care after age 18, the medical card ends. The young person is often left in medical care limbo with few options. That changed with Illinois’ implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act. As of January 2014 there is a new Medicaid eligibility group that includes young people up to the age of 26 who were formerly in foster care. Additionally, young people who left DCFS through adoption or guardianship can also apply for health care benefits through Medicaid. They may be eligible based on low-income, disability or if they have dependent children.&nbsp;</p><p>Eligibility information and the application process are on the website Application for Benefits Eligibility (ABE) at <a href=\"http://www.abe.illinois.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">www.ABE.illinois.gov</a>. Applications for Medicaid can also be submitted by calling the toll-free number 800-843-6154. The ABE website is streamlined and designed to be easy to use, and if needed the DCFS Health Services staff can help with questions. Call 217-557-2689.</p><p>Section 7, Page 24</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p><strong>Why would “independence” be chosen for a foster youth, instead of adoption or guardianship?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A permanent family for older foster youth may not be possible, or in the best interests of the youth. Independence can be chosen for a youth over age 15, only after returning home, adoption and guardianship have been ruled out. Sometimes, older youth do not want to be adopted or have a guardian because they are very connected to their own family. Pregnant and/or parenting teens may feel ready to establish their own family living situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Specific guidelines for choosing “independence” for a youth over age 15 are:</p><ul><li>return home, adoption and guardianship have been ruled out; and&nbsp;</li><li>the youth shows that he or she is capable and willing to care for him or herself, become economically self-sufficient and/or is establishing a family of their own; or&nbsp;</li><li>a child who has a physical or mental disability demonstrates the ability, capability and willingness to care for themselves with proper support; and&nbsp;</li><li>the child demonstrates the ability to achieve and maintain progress towards independence through continued cooperation with the service plan; or&nbsp;</li><li>the court has ordered a permanency goal of independence, where the minor over age 16 will be in substitute care pending emancipation.</li></ul><p><strong>What can caregivers do to help transition youth to independent living?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Youth face many challenges in leaving foster care. Caregivers can help kids make the transition between foster care and being independent less scary and lonely by providing personal help and support to youth in making key personal and educational decisions. Experiences provided in the home can help and support youth in learning skills they will need to live independently. Caregivers can also be helpful in connecting foster youth to agency or DCFS-sponsored support programs and scholarships, as well as other educational or personal supports offered outside the child welfare system. Several PRIDE In-Service training modules are available to caregivers to help them parent teens in foster care. Contact the DCFS Office of Training at <a href=\"http://www.dcfstraining.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.dcfstraining.org</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Caregivers can also encourage youth to develop and maintain family relationships. If the young person has siblings in DCFS care, he or she will be included in developing the Visitation and Contact Plan when it is clinically appropriate. The caseworker will assist the youth in connecting with siblings who are not in DCFS care and help obtain transportation for sibling visits.</p><p><strong>What services will youth receive from DCFS or the private agency?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><em>When a youth reaches the age of 14, the DCFS or private agency caseworker will meet with him or her to complete a life skills assessment.</em> The life skills assessment is a tool designed to help caseworkers review a youth’s knowledge and skills related to subjects such as money management, health and safety, job seeking and retention, nutrition, housing, education and similar activities.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the results of the assessment, a transition plan is developed to guide the youth and the caregiver on what the youth can do to improve knowledge and skills needed to live on her own. This plan becomes part of the youth’s overall client service plan and will be reviewed at future administrative case reviews.&nbsp;</p><p>A wide variety of supportive services are available to youth depending on his or her needs either directly through the department or through a referral to a community resource, including the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Life Skills Class:</strong> available for youth who require more structured skills training; generally appropriate for youth aged 16 or older. Some of the areas covered include renting an apartment, seeking legal advice, shopping for the best bargain and choosing a roommate. Decision-making skills are also emphasized; &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Educational Supports:</strong> tutoring, GED preparation, scholarships;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Job-related Services:</strong> vocational training, job placement, etc.;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Recreational Events and Workshops;&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Support Groups:</strong> Youth in Care Network, Youth Advisory Board; and&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Independent Living Placements:</strong> Supervised Independent Living Program, Youth in Transition Program, Youth in College Program.</li></ul><p>Section 7, Page 23</p>\n  </div>"

These rights include: visitation, consent to adoption, choice of religion and the right to claim the body of a deceased child.&nbsp;</p><p>The court makes all decisions regarding the transfer of guardianship, but the birth parent/s can request that guardianship be taken away from the caregiver and that the child be returned to their care if parental rights have not been terminated.&nbsp;</p><p>If the birth parent/s’ parental rights are terminated the guardian may legally adopt the child with DCFS’ help.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Decision Making</strong></td><td>All decisions are made by the adoptive parent/s.</td><td><p>Major decisions regarding school, medical treatment and consent for most other major life decisions are made by the guardian.&nbsp;</p><p>Birth parent/s retain important rights, e.g., choice of religion, visitation and consent to adoption when parental rights have not been relinquished or terminated.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Financial Assistance</strong></td><td>The adoptive parent/s, whether receiving a subsidy or not, are financially responsible for the support of the child. Financial assistance is available for the adoption of many department children. See page 8 for details.</td><td>A guardian, whether receiving a subsidy or not, is fi nancially liable for the support of the child. Financial assistance is available for eligible children. See page 13 for details. The guardian is responsible for fi nancially supporting the child until DCFS stops the subsidy payment and the court vacates guardianship (whichever event happens last). If the birth parent/s’ rights have not been terminated they can be held responsible to contribute to the financial support of the child.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Relation\u0002ship with the Birth Parent/s</strong></td><td>The adoptive parent/s have the right to determine if the child will have any relationship with the birth parent/s.</td><td>If the birth parent/s’ rights have not been terminated, they have the right to visit the child unless a court orders no visits. The guardian will have input into how the visits are structured, but can not prevent visits from occurring. If the guardian and the parent/s can not work out visitation scheduling, one of the parties may wish to seek court involvement. Birth parent/s also have the right to petition the court to have the child returned to them.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Child’s Legal Name</strong></td><td>The adoptive parent/s determine the child’s legal name.</td><td>Usually the child retains his/her own legal last name.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Inheritance</strong></td><td>An adopted child has all of the same rights as birth children when the adoptive parent/s does not have a will. Otherwise, inheritance rights are established through a valid will as they are for birth children.</td><td>The child has no rights of inheritance from the guardian unless the child has been included in the guardian’s will.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Consent of the Child</strong></td><td>A child who is 14 years of age or older must consent to his/ her own adoption.</td><td>A child who is 14 years of age or older must consent to the transfer of guardianship from the department to an individual. In addition, a child who is 13 years of age or older can petition for a change of guardianship.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Death of Adoptive Parent/ Guardian or Termination of Adoption/ Guardianship</strong></td><td>A child adopted with adoption assistance remains eligible for adoption assistance when he/she is orphaned due to the death of his/her adoptive parent/s or when a court terminates the adoptive parent/s parental rights. He or she can continue to receive adoption assistance if adopted by someone else.</td><td>A child that moves to subsidized guardianship under KinGAP does not retain eligibility for a subsidy in a subsequent guardianship.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Returning a Child to DCFS</strong></td><td>An adopted child would have to be found by the court to be abused, neglected or dependent in order to have DCFS again assume legal responsibility for the child.</td><td>A child for whom an individual has been named guardian would have to be found by the court to be abused, neglected or dependent or other good cause must exist in order for DCFS to again assume legal responsibility for the child. Or the guardian or other interested party would have to petition the court to have the guardian relieved of the responsibility of guardianship.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Note: Adoption assistance and subsidized guardianship ongoing monthly payments are the same as the foster care board payments that were received while the child was in foster care.</p><p>Both adoption and guardianship are evidence of strong commitments to children. The commitment entered into by adopting a child is one that lasts for a lifetime. Although guardianship legally ends when the child reaches adulthood, most legal guardians enter into this commitment intending it to be a lifetime relationship. Thus, adoption and guardianship are commitments to be taken seriously by caregivers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>Children need to feel secure to develop in a healthy way. Two important ways that children can feel more secure are through their family’s ability to operate independently without feeling that someone could easily disrupt the family and by providing certainty that they will remain together as a family for life—having a permanent family and home. Without permanency, children often experience doubt, uncertainty and hesitancy about where they belong and who is going to care for them. A secure home and a family committed to caring gives the child a sense of attachment which is needed to promote healthy growth and development.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you are willing to raise the child in your care until adulthood, unless you have <em><strong>legal</strong></em> responsibility for the child, your family situation cannot be considered “permanent.” For example, if the child welfare system continues to maintain <em><strong>legal</strong></em> responsibility for the child instead of you, then the child’s caseworker must continue to monitor the care of the child. The court will continue to review your case, and there is always the possibility that the child will be removed from your family. Legal permanency allows the child welfare system and the court system to close the child’s case and allows your family to raise the children and make important decisions for them without state intrusion. With legal permanency, children feel a sense of security.&nbsp;</p><p>In order for a child to be adopted, the birth parents’ rights must be legally terminated or surrendered. This means that the birth parents’ rights are <em>permanently</em> taken away. If you choose to become the legal guardian of the child, the birth parents’ rights do not have to be terminated and the child could someday be returned to them.&nbsp;</p><p>Not every foster family adopts children or becomes a legal guardian, but many do. In fact, the majority of the children adopted in Illinois are adopted by their foster family. While adoption and guardianship provide you with many of the same rights (for example, enrolling the child in school, consent to major medical care, etc.), adoption is a lifelong legal relationship. The legal relationship with guardianship ends when the child turns 18 and is considered an adult. However, both adoption and guardianship allow for lifelong emotional ties and relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Your caseworker and the rest of the child welfare team can help determine what is the best permanent home arrangement for the child in your care. The best way to help make this decision is to tell your caseworker everything you know about the child and keep in mind what you truly believe to be in the child’s best interest for future care.&nbsp;</p><p>The following pages may help you and your family decide your role in the future of the child in your home.</p><p>The following series of questions may help you think through what might be best for the child in your care:</p><ol><li>If the child/ren cannot return home to their parent/s, the best long range plan is for them to stay with me.&nbsp;</li><li>I am interested in caring for the child/ren without caseworker intervention. &nbsp;</li><li>I am capable of caring for the child/ren without caseworker intervention.&nbsp;</li><li>I have the support from family, friends, community, etc. that I need to raise the child/ren.&nbsp;</li><li>I am willing and able to work with the school to address the child/ren’s needs.&nbsp;</li><li>I am willing and able to manage visits/relationships between the parent/s and child/ren to ensure the child/ren’s safety. (Note: This is only a consideration for guardianship when parental rights have not been terminated. When a child is adopted, the adoptive parents may decide if a child will have contact with their biological parents.)&nbsp;</li><li>I am willing and able to continue providing a safe and stable home environment for the child/ren.&nbsp;</li><li>I am confident in my ability to manage family issues such as illness and child-rearing problems. &nbsp;</li><li>I do not have health conditions that would signifi cantly limit my ability to care for the child/ren.&nbsp;</li><li>I am willing to accept the subsidy payment in lieu of my current payment/s.&nbsp;</li><li>I am aware of the services available in the subsidy agreement and am willing to accept those services to meet the child’s needs.&nbsp;</li><li>The child is well integrated into my family.&nbsp;</li><li>I am willing to pursue adoption for the child/ren.&nbsp;<ul><li>If your answers to all of the previous questions were “yes,” then most likely you should discuss adopting the child with your caseworker.&nbsp;</li><li>If you answered “no” to number 13, then you should discuss being named the child’s legal guardian with or without receipt of a subsidy.&nbsp;</li><li>If several of your answers were “no,” your caseworker will discuss other options for the child.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Please also consider the following if your answer to number 13 was “no”.</p><ol><li>The child does not want to be adopted (age 14 and over).</li><li>I do not want the birth parents’ rights to be terminated.</li><li>I am separated and do not want to obtain a divorce.*</li><li>I am uncomfortable with changing our family relationships.</li><li>I do not want the child to be my heir</li><li>I feel too old to adopt.</li><li>I am hopeful that the birth parent/s will ultimately get the child back.</li></ol><p>Your caseworker can discuss your answers to the above statements and help you determine whether adoption would be best for the child.&nbsp;</p><p>* If you are separated, but not divorced, you may be eligible to adopt a child if you have been separated more than one year (<em>DCFS Procedure 402</em>).</p><p>Section 7, Page 17</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p><strong>What is guardianship?</strong></p><p>Guardianship means that the court appoints you as the child’s legal guardian. It differs from adoption because the birth parents’ rights do not have to be terminated in order to appoint a guardian. When you are appointed guardian of the child, DCFS will not be involved in the care, supervision or legal custody of the child. However, the court will retain jurisdiction until the child reaches the age of 18. As guardian, you assume the rights and responsibilities to make decisions in matters having an effect on the life and the development of the child. Families becoming guardians of children in the care of DCFS may receive subsidies that include financial assistance, as well as services and resources described in detail on pages 13-14.</p><p>Guardianship lasts until the child reaches the age of 18 years. The permanency options of return home and adoption must have been ruled out for a child to be considered for guardianship. The child’s parent(s) may consent to the guardianship arrangement and if they do not consent, they will be given notice of their opportunity to object in court unless their parental rights have been relinquished or terminated.</p><p><strong>Who is eligible for guardianship?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Guardianship can be considered for children who have been living in the home of a licensed relative foster family for a period of six consecutive months. The relative home must have been licensed for the entire six month period. The goals of return home and adoption must also have been ruled out prior to pursuing a goal of guardianship.&nbsp;</p><p>The child should have a strong attachment to the potential guardian and the guardian should have a strong commitment to the child. Children of all ages may be considered for guardianship if they have lived with a licensed relative foster family for six months. Siblings who otherwise would not be eligible for guardianship may also qualify if they have a brother or sister in the same home that does meet the criteria.&nbsp;</p><p>For children living with foster families that are not relatives, with documentation and approval, DCFS could determine that subsidized guardianship is in the best interest of a child who is 14 years or older. The child 14 years and older must also have been living with the licensed non-relative for a period of six consecutive months for the guardianship to be considered.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a sibling exception for the siblings who otherwise would not be eligible for guardianship, if they live in the same house as a brother or sister who is eligible for guardianship. However, the exception only applies for siblings living in relative foster homes.</p><p><strong>What is subsidized guardianship?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In 1996, the State of Illinois received special permission from the federal government (called a waiver) to institute a subsidy for guardians in certain circumstances. Subsidized guardianship means that you become the permanent legal guardian of the child in your care as described above and the state contributes financial assistance (a subsidy) for the care of the child. The subsidy continues until the child reaches 18, or 19 if still in high school. The department may continue the agreement until the child’s 21st birthday if it determines that the child has a physical, mental or emotional disability that is “chronic,” thus warranting the continuation of assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>Experiences of guardianship families in Illinois and the early pilot subsidized guardianship resulted in federal legislation called the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. This legislation ended the waiver demonstration project and launched the program KinGAP (Kinship Guardianship Assistance Payment) which Illinois implemented in November of 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>Important differences of KinGAP from the original waiver program:</p><ol><li>KinGAP is available to any child in licensed, relative homes, while the Subsidized Guardianship waiver randomly selected children to be in a demonstration group to be eligible for subsidized guardianship, regardless of the licensing status of the proposed guardian;&nbsp;</li><li>a child must have lived in a licensed relative home for six consecutive months versus the 1 year requirement of the subsidized guardianship waiver, which had no licensing requirement; and&nbsp;</li><li>KinGAP is restricted to relative homes according to the federal government, however, Illinois is making an exception for youth 14 years of age and older to be considered for guardianship with licensed non-relatives.</li></ol><p>Section 7, Page 10</p>\n  </div>"

If the decision is made that it is in the child’s best interest to be adopted by you, the child’s caseworker will tell you what steps need to be taken. The child’s caseworker will give you all of the necessary paperwork to apply for adoption assistance if the child has special needs or otherwise fits the eligibility criteria. You will also have to go to court to have a hearing to legally finalize the adoption. You will need to choose your own attorney to represent you as you adopt a child who is under the guardianship of DCFS. DCFS and private agency staff are not permitted to refer adoptive parents to specific attorneys. However, caregivers may select from a list of attorneys who meet certain qualifications set out by DCFS and who are paid directly by DCFS for serving as adoption attorneys. Ask your worker if you would like a copy of this list. Caregivers who desire to adopt a child from foster care must complete the Adoption/Guardianship Certification Training. The caseworker or the adoption worker will make the referral for the training.</p><p><strong>Can I adopt a child not placed in my home?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Caregivers, like anyone interested in adopting a waiting child, should contact the Adoption Information Center of Illinois, 800-572-2390 inside Illinois or 312-346- 1516 outside Illinois. Photo listings of waiting Illinois children who are legally free for adoption are available. Like other prospective adoptive parents, caregivers will be referred to the waiting child’s caseworker for more information about the child. Caregivers who are interested in a waiting child living with another caregiver who is unable to adopt, should contact the child’s caseworker to get more information and discuss the possibility of adoption.</p><p><strong>What background information about the child will I have prior to adopting?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The adoption process attempts to match the individual needs of a waiting child with the skills and abilities of a prospective family. Prospective adoptive parents for a child will be given more and more information about the child as the adoption process progresses.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, Illinois law requires that adoptive parents be given background information and medical and mental health histories prior to a child being placed with them for adoption. The following information, if known, will be given to adoptive parent/s <em>in writing:</em></p><ul><li>age of birth parents;&nbsp;</li><li>their race, religion and ethnic background;&nbsp;</li><li>general physical appearance of the birth parents;&nbsp;</li><li>their education, occupation, hobbies, interests and talents;&nbsp;</li><li>existence of any other children born to the birth parents;&nbsp;</li><li>information about the birth grandparents; reason for emigrating into the U.S., if applicable, and country of origin;&nbsp;</li><li>relationship between the birth parents;&nbsp;</li><li>detailed medical and mental health histories of the child, the birth parents and their immediate relatives; and&nbsp;</li><li>the actual date and place of birth of the adopted person.</li></ul><p>The Adoption Disclosure form (CFS 470-H) must be given to the prospective adoptive parent prior to signing off on any commitment forms. This form will confirm the information that the adoption worker has shared with the prospective adoptive parents.&nbsp;</p><p>None of this information will include the last known address of the birth parents, grandparents, the siblings of the birth parents or any other relative of the adopted child. Names, social security numbers and other identifying information about the birth family will remain confidential.</p><p>Section 7, Page 5</p>\n  </div>"

Youth in foster care may only be enrolled in a GED program if they are ineligible to be enrolled in a public school district. A youth is ineligible for regular school enrollment when he or she has been expelled or is over age 19 and cannot graduate by age 21. If your student fits this description, consult with your caseworker and educational personnel about enrolling in an Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) certified GED program.</p><p><strong>Planning for the Future&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If the permanency goal for your high school student is independent living or self sufficiency, educational planning or vocational planning should begin no later than age 14. There are many resources, including DCFS sponsored scholarships, available to children and families to assist students in preparing for educational opportunities after high school. See Section 7, pages 22-29 for DCFS-sponsored Independent Living and Youth Development programs for high school and college youth. The DCFS website <a href=\"http://www.youthincare.illinois.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">www.youthincare.illinois.gov</a> outlines many resources for youth transitioning to adulthood.</p>\n  </div>"

Every child in foster care, at a minimum, is expected to be enrolled in school or training until he or she graduates or reaches age 18. Special educational services are available until the child reaches age 22, if necessary. (Students may, by law, attend school until age 21 or until they receive a diploma.)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Enrollment Deadlines&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Caregivers must enroll a child in school as soon as possible after placement or within two days after placement</em>. If the child is not attending school within two days, caregivers must ask the caseworker for help on, or before, the third day following placement. If the caseworker cannot enroll the child by the fifth day after placement, he or she is expected to notify their education advisor or liaison.</p><p><strong>School Choice&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Usually a child will attend the caregiver’s local neighborhood public school, but not always. For those school districts that offer school choice, the caregiver and caseworker team should make choices based upon the best educational and personal interests of the child. In the case of disagreement over school attendance, the caseworker has the responsibility for determining best educational interests of the child.</p><p><strong>Moving Outside the District — Remaining in the Current School&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Caseworkers may decide, after careful study, that it is in the child’s best interest to remain in the same school after moving outside the school district. For example: The caseworker of a 17-year-old may decide to keep the student in the same high school and neighborhood where he has lived his whole life to give him a greater chance of graduating.</p><p><strong>Tuition</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Under the School Code, if the caseworker and DCFS determine that continuing the child’s current school is in her best interest, the school district cannot charge the tuition normally charged to children who do not reside in the district.</p><p><strong>Transportation</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>If the caregiver/caseworker team determine that the child should remain at the current school, the caseworker should ask the school district to provide transportation. Unfortunately, the School Code does not require the school district to provide transportation in these cases. Therefore, if the school district refuses to transport, the caseworker must work with you to arrange transportation. The decision of the school district is not subject to appeal.</p><p><em><strong>Implications for Caregivers:</strong> Clarify which school the child will be attending and the transportation arrangements with the caseworker prior to placement. Work to encourage a team approach with the caseworker for educational decision making.</em></p><p><strong>Private Schools&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Students who may be eligible for scholarships, and want to attend private grade or high schools, should discuss their desire with the caseworker. Caregivers who are interested in a child attending a <em>private school</em> through a scholarship or by paying tuition themselves on behalf of the child should consult with the caseworker. DCFS does not pay private school tuition, uniform costs, or transportation to and from school. If the caregiver wishes to enroll a child in a religious-based school, consent by the parent for religious instruction must be obtained on the appropriate DCFS form.</p><p><strong>Home Schooling&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Children in foster care generally may not be home schooled.</p><p>Section 6, Page 13</p>\n  </div>"

What this means is that federal and state law assign the foster caregiver with the authority and responsibility to serve as the “parent” in all matters regarding special education. An Educational Surrogate Parent (ESP) is required when a child is placed in residential care. Foster caregivers are encouraged to serve as the ESP for children in their care who move into residential care. When reunification is the goal, the foster caregiver and the child’s parent can share in the educational responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>The caregivers have the responsibility to ensure that the school provides the student with a free, appropriate public education by:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>understanding the child and his or her educational needs, including the child’s strengths, interests and abilities;&nbsp;</li><li>requesting case study evaluations;&nbsp;</li><li>signing consents for case study evaluations, the initial educational placement and educational re-evaluations;&nbsp;</li><li>attending educational meetings, eligibility conferences and Individualized Education Plan (IEP) meetings; &nbsp;</li><li>negotiating for appropriate special education services;&nbsp;</li><li>requesting complaint investigations, mediation and/or impartial due process hearings;&nbsp;</li><li>participating in due process hearings related to the child’s needs;</li><li>seeking legal advice, when necessary, to advocate for the child’s needs; and&nbsp;</li><li>communicating with the student’s caseworker regarding the student’s educational needs.</li></ul><p>Caregivers must also:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>within two days after placement, enroll the child in school or if needed, pursue early intervention services for children three and under;&nbsp;</li><li>attend school meetings and participate in early intervention services;&nbsp;</li><li>talk to the child’s teacher or others involved on a regular basis;&nbsp;</li><li>work as a team with the child’s caseworker; and&nbsp;</li><li>represent the child in a positive manner.</li></ul><p>Becoming a Surrogate for Other Children&nbsp;</p><p>Caregivers may also volunteer to be an educational surrogate for children who are in residential care or in the Department of Corrections, up to a maximum of 10 students a semester, providing those students are educated in facilities or schools in close proximity.

In order to develop the service plan, all children entering DCFS care receive an Integrated Assessment, which includes an initial educational assessment, within 30 days of temporary custody. The caseworker is responsible to complete the initial educational assessment and document it on the CFS-407-4 within 30 days of placement. The CFS 407-4 is then used to develop the initial educational plan (CFS 497, Part III) which will be reviewed at the first Administrative Case Review (ACR) within 45 days of custody.&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops:47.65pt;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In some cases, it will be necessary to obtain professional educational assessments to determine the unique needs of the child.

Confidentiality of information surrounding an adult or child’s status is written in the AIDS Confidentiality Act and in DCFS rules and procedures.</p><p><strong>Who “needs to know” about HIV status?</strong><br>Release of information about the HIV status of a child in foster care is based on the person’s “need to know.” Those with a need to know include: birth parents, guardian, caregivers, relative caretakers, directors of child care facilities, staff who provide direct personal care, medical providers of direct personal care, other persons who need to know in order to provide services.</p><p><strong>DCFS Policy: Disclosing HIV Status</strong><br>DCFS is not authorized to release the HIV status of persons for whom DCFS is not legally responsible, including parents. Parents are responsible for informing service providers of their family’s HIV status, or they may sign consents for DCFS to release this information.</p><p>If a child is known to have been exposed to the HIV virus or tested HIV positive, the caseworker or agency must inform the child’s caregivers.</p><p>If a teacher, caretaker, or someone else may need to know about the child’s HIV status, consult with the caseworker or DCFS AIDS Project. Caregivers should NOT communicate this information themselves, but should ask the caseworker to communicate what needs to be known. The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services informs the school superintendent, who may inform the principal, teacher and school nurse, if necessary. If the court needs to be informed, the information should be shared by attorneys or caseworkers privately with a judge, in chambers.</p><p>HIV status should not be written where it can be seen by people who do not have a need to know. The dates of HIV testing may be written on the child’s Health Passport. However, the results of HIV testing must be kept in a separate and confidential section of any case record. Disclosure of positive HIV information requires the consent of the DCFS Guardian and youth 12 years of age and older.</p><h4>Special Health Considerations</h4><p>In a foster home setting, the only potential mode of HIV transmission is infected blood or semen penetrating beneath the skin into the body tissues.</p><p>Three universal precautions to be used by the whole family are:</p><ol><li>use a cloth barrier or wear gloves when caring for bleeding wounds,<br>nosebleeds, bloody diarrhea and diaper changes;</li><li>clean surfaces exposed to blood with a bleach solution<br>(ratio of 1 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water); and</li><li>consistently wash hands (and teach children to wash hands) with soap<br>and warm water.</li></ol><p>Children in the home should not share teething toys, feeding bottles or toothbrushes, as some bleeding may occur from the gums at the time the child is teething or losing baby teeth.</p><p>Adults and youth should not share razors or syringes.</p><p>Biting and other aggressive behavior on the part of all children should be discouraged, but it has not been known to lead to HIV infection.</p><p>All foster families should use these universal precautions as a matter of good hygiene.

Treatment requires the consent of the guardian or authorized agent. &nbsp;</p><h4>Physician’s Right to Test&nbsp;</h4><p>A physician may test a patient without consent in order to provide appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The physician should, however, provide counseling and inform the guardian.&nbsp;</p><h4>Symptoms Suggesting Testing May Be Needed&nbsp;</h4><p>Talk to the child’s HealthWorks primary care physician and the caseworker if your preteen or teen is or may be using drugs or alcohol, or is or may be involved in risky sexual behaviors. He or she may be at higher risk of HIV infection.&nbsp;</p><p>Symptoms suggesting a need for HIV testing include:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>persistent fevers;&nbsp;</li><li>poor weight gain or rapid weight loss;&nbsp;</li><li>frequent diarrhea;&nbsp;</li><li>recurring or unusual infections;&nbsp;</li><li>chronic lymph node swelling;&nbsp;</li><li>persistent or recurring extreme tiredness or lethargy;&nbsp;</li><li>white spots in the mouth; and &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>loss of appetite.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Caregivers may also get confidential information and advice from the DCFS AIDS Project (See page 34) about working with any child/youth who may be at risk of HIV and AIDS.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Caregivers Have a Need to Know About HIV Test Results&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>If DCFS knows of a child’s exposure to HIV or HIV infection, the DCFS AIDS Project should be notified immediately. Additionally, the caseworker should tell the caregiver about the child’s status <em>prior to placement</em> in order to prepare the family to make an informed decision about taking care of the child.&nbsp;</p><p>The realities of foster care are that sometimes, initially, the history is unknown until after the child is placed into the foster home. In this case, foster families may be notified of the child’s HIV status aft er the fact. In either case, the AIDS Project would provide training and on-going support services about HIV issues.</p><h4>Babies Under 18 Months Old&nbsp;</h4><p>Caregivers taking a baby under 18 months old should ask the caseworker if the baby has been tested for HIV. Children under 18 months who are known to have been exposed to HIV are followed by a qualified HIV clinic for further diagnosis and treatment. The AIDS Project will help make this linkage.&nbsp;</p><p>Studies have shown that the majority of children exposed to HIV in their mother’s womb, or at the time of birth, have not contracted the HIV virus. New protocols for delivering and treating the baby and the mother have reduced the national perinatal infection rate from 25 percent to just 2 percent. Many babies who initially test positive in infancy lose their mother’s antibodies and will test negative by 18 months because they are not infected.&nbsp;</p><h4>Adolescents &nbsp;</h4><p>More of the infected children in foster care will be of adolescent age. Youth 12 and older should be included in the decision to test for HIV according to the risk factors. Youth 12 and older should also be consulted about any disclosure of their HIV status and consent should be sought for the release of information.&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>Children need to learn about HIV and AIDS at a very early age. By the time your children are 3 or 4 years old, make sure you have clearly explained the following:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>cover cuts and sores with bandages or gauze pads to avoid contact with any kind of germs.&nbsp;</li><li>never touch needles or syringes. If they see someone who is bleeding or if they find a needle or syringe, they should tell an adult. Remind your children never to touch a needle or syringe if they find one in the garbage or on the ground; and&nbsp;</li><li>AIDS cannot be caught by playing with HIV-infected children.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>By grade-school age, your child should begin to have a better understanding of illness and body parts. He or she should begin to learn more about how HIV can and cannot be spread.&nbsp;</p><h4>Sex&nbsp;</h4><p>Adolescents and teens need to know that the best way to protect themselves against HIV and AIDS is not to have any type of sexual intercourse. Reassure the child that it is all right to postpone sexual intercourse until he or she is married or in a long-term, mature relationship. If adolescents or teens do not postpone having sexual intercourse, then regular and proper use of latex condoms and limiting the relationship to one partner will help them avoid HIV infection. This will also lower the risk of getting other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia infection and genital warts. Adolescents should also know about other types of birth control. However, it should be emphasized that other forms of birth control do NOT prevent HIV infection or other STDs.</p><h4>Drugs</h4><p>Adolescents need to know about the extreme risk of being infected with HIV if they use drugs, especially intravenous (IV) drugs that are injected with needles. Sharing a needle or syringe spreads blood from one person to another. A nondrug user who has sexual intercourse with an HIV-infected drug user can be infected with HIV. Sharing needles for non-drug use, such as for tattoos, ear piercing, purposely scarring or cutting oneself with needles or razors, or injecting drugs including steroids, can also spread HIV.&nbsp;</p><p>Talk to your adolescent about drugs to make sure he or she understands that using any drugs, including alcohol, is not healthy. The risk of gett ing HIV increases even when non-IV drugs, like alcohol or cocaine, are used because these drugs aff ect a person’s judgment and may lead to risky behaviors — such as having sexual intercourse without a latex condom or having sex with multiple partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>"

Consultation and help is available at all levels for children and families. &nbsp;Most local school districts have access to or provide substance abuse prevention services. &nbsp;The caregiver should work in concert with the caseworker to access these services.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Many youth think using drugs, alcohol and inhalants will make them happy or popular, or help them learn the skills they need when they grow up. All children need to know abusing substances can cause them to fail at all of those things and may even cause their death. If children think “everybody’s doing it”, they need to know they’re wrong, and there is no one bett er to tell them than YOU.&nbsp;</p><h4>Talking Can be Hard, But it is Important&nbsp;</h4><p>Surveys show &nbsp;drug use is less among kids whose parents “warn” against it, than whose parents never discussed it. “Warning” is not yelling. Talking with youth at a level they can understand shows them you care, as well as where you stand on the issue. Many parents don’t know how to bring up the subject or feel like youth know more than they do. Adolescents or teens may resist eff orts to talk. Some parents think their child is too young to know about drugs. Don’t hesitate— start talking!</p><h4>Be Realistic</h4><p>A child cannot get through childhood, adolescence, or their teen years without running into drugs. To many children in care, family drug use is “normal.” Don’t try to compare today’s world with the one you lived in at the same age. Farm, city, or suburbs — drugs are everywhere. Children will assume that if they’ve tried a drug once and nothing bad happened, they will be OK the next time. Today, over half the students in high school have experimented with drugs before they finish high school. Since the drug culture of the 1960’s, drug use has not only increased, but drug variety and potency has increased too.</p><h4>Set a Good Example&nbsp;</h4><p>Examine your own use of drugs and alcohol. Do you tell children not to drink and then celebrate important occasions by getting a “buzz”? Do you need prescription drugs to “relax”? Children know what’s going on. It is important to practice what you preach.&nbsp;</p><h4>Know the Facts&nbsp;</h4><p>Educate yourself about drugs. PRIDE Training Module 10, available to all caregivers, covers substance abuse and fostering children from chemically dependent families. Information about drugs and alcohol is available at your local library or health department and through the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Plan What to Say and Where to Say It&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Look for a calm time, like riding in the car, where you can both talk without being interrupted. Know exactly how you feel. Make sure other adults living in your home feel the same way, so children won’t receive “mixed” messages. Review ahead what you want to say. Don’t wait for the crisis — start talking NOW!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When the Talking Time Comes&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Don’t lecture. Let your child talk, too. Listen. Be respectful of her right to talk and have an opinion.&nbsp;</p><p>Clarify family rules about substance abuse. If you don’t know the answer to a question, say so. Suggest that you both fi nd the answer together. Discuss situations in which your child may be pressured to use drugs or alcohol and how to say “No”! &nbsp;Keep the conversation going from childhood to adulthood. Keeping communication lines open and taking time to talk whenever possible will help your child in making choices when you aren’t there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>"

When you report this behavior to the caseworker or DCFS Hotline, the caseworker or hotline staff &nbsp;person makes an “unusual incident” report to DCFS. If the sexual acting out constitutes a criminal act, the police will be notified. Legal action can be taken as needed and appropriate.&nbsp;</p><h4>Criteria for Identifying a Sexual Behavior Problem&nbsp;</h4><p>Sexual behavior problem is very simply defined: children or youth who exhibit sexual behavior that is unusual or unexpected for their age or who have acted out sexually. The term describes a broad range of behaviors including those that are and those that are not harmful to others.</p><p>Children with sexual behavior problems may exhibit “no contact” behaviors, where they have not touched anyone else, or &nbsp;“hands-on” behaviors like fondling another child, rubbing against them, or simulating intercourse. Without treatment, the child may progress to more problematic sexual behaviors like tricking or bribing other children and, in rare cases, forcing them to engage in sex. Once you have reported the behavior to the child’s caseworker, the child will be referred to a treatment provider specializing in children’s behavior problems or disorders. &nbsp;The treatment provider will be able to give you detailed information about the nature of the problem, the level of supervision the child needs and the issues that will be addressed in treatment.&nbsp;</p><h4>DCFS Policy: Safety&nbsp;</h4><p>Within 24 hours of the report of the sexual misbehavior, the child’s caseworker will conduct a review of the incident, the child’s need for supervision and whether other younger, smaller, less able children in the home might be at risk. &nbsp;In many cases, the sexual behaviors go away aft er four to five months of treatment. &nbsp;</p><p>In order to protect all children, the department requires the following:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>the child with sexual behavior problems should not share a bedroom with other children who may be vulnerable; &nbsp;</li><li>the caseworker must develop a written plan for supervision describing how the child will be supervised and who is responsible; and&nbsp;</li><li>the caregiver must evaluate his or her ability to provide the child with an appropriate level of supervision.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>A written plan for supervision will be completed by the caseworker within 24 hours of receiving the Unusual Incident Report, and will describe:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>how the child will be supervised during contact with other children or possibly vulnerable persons; and&nbsp;</li><li>how others will be informed of the child’s behavior problem, on a “need-to-know” basis, and in keeping with confidentiality requirements.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While the caseworker is responsible for developing the plan for supervision, others must also be involved: the child, if age 12 or older; the primary caregiver; the caseworker’s supervisor; the DCFS sexual behavior specialist; the counselor, if the child is already receiving treatment; and others responsible for supervision of the child. Every person involved in making the plan for supervision will receive a copy of it.&nbsp;</p><h4>Staffing: Determining Services&nbsp;</h4><p><em>Within three weeks </em>of the report to the DCFS hotline and the completion of the unusual incident report to DCFS, there will be a multidisciplinary staffing to evaluate the child’s behavior and treatment needs from a developmental perspective. &nbsp;The department requires the participation of others who know the child, such as the caseworker, the foster caregivers and therapist, if there is one. &nbsp;As appropriate, children over the age of 12 may be asked to participate.</p><h4>Services and Treatment&nbsp;</h4><p>If a determination is made at the staffing that a child’s behavior needs further evaluation or that the child has treatment needs, the caseworker will make the referral for clinical services as recommended at the staffing such as those provided by a psychologist or a social worker. Usually, the first step is an orientation for evaluation and treatment, which will occur within 15 days of the date of referral. This is an informal meeting, and it should include discussion with the child, the parent/s, caregivers, caseworker and anyone the child considers to be important in his life.&nbsp;</p><p>Treatment begins with an evaluation of the child’s overall functioning. There will be tests and interviews with the child to determine treatment needed, and a plan will be developed. The goal is for the child to “successfully” complete treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>Most people consider treatment of the behavior problem “successful” when the child no longer exhibits the behavior.&nbsp;</p><h4>If the Child Moves to a New Foster Family&nbsp;</h4><p>The caseworker will give the new caregivers information about the child’s sexual behavior problem. The department requires caseworkers to inform foster parents of all such problems. It also requires the caregiver to sign a new plan for supervision.</p><p><strong>Confidentiality&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The child’s plan for supervision will list the adults responsible for supervising the child. These persons could include school personnel, child care providers, church staff , recreational leaders and others who have a need to know. The caseworker (not the caregiver) is responsible for informing others who need to know about the child’s behavior problem and his or her need for supervision. DCFS’ Guardian or designee must give signed consent for this information to be shared. Anyone who is informed of the child’s behavior problem will also be informed of confidentiality requirements, including not sharing the information with anyone else without the department’s consent.</p><p>If anyone responsible for the care and supervision of the child does not agree to provide appropriate supervision, other arrangements for the child will be made.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><em>The therapist working with the child, the child’s caseworker, caregivers, sexual behavior specialist and members of the multidisciplinary team will determine when the child no longer needs a written plan for supervision. &nbsp;In children under the age of 13, this is usually after six months have passed without an incident of sexual misbehavior. &nbsp;Older children or youth are more likely to have more complex behaviors and treatment needs. Removal of the plan for supervision will occur upon recommendation of the therapist and the multidisciplinary team.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>"

These sexual behaviors may be indications of problems which need immediate attention. The child’s caseworker will assist you in obtaining appropriate treatment for the behavior problems.&nbsp;</p><p>While you are waiting for assessment of the child’s sexual behavior problem, you should provide closer supervision - especially in the bathroom and at night. This child should not be left unsupervised with other younger, smaller, or less mature children until the treatment provider approves doing so.&nbsp;</p><p>Classroom and digital training are both available on this topic. The PRIDE course, Module 4: The Sexual Development of Children, addresses the physical and emotional expectations as youth mature. A new course called Promoting Healthy Sexual Development helps caregivers have discussions with youth in order to prevent or delay pregnancy and reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. The course descriptions and schedules are available on the DCFS Virtual Training Center website at <a href=\"http://www.DCFSTraining.org\">www.DCFSTraining.org</a> or call the DCFS Office of Training at 877-800-3393 during regular business hours. &nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li><strong>A child’s sexual behavior is different than the behaviors of other children in the same age group.</strong> Example: It is not unusual to see a 3-year-old girl rubbing between her legs as she sits on the couch watching television. However, we would not expect this in a 16-year-old girl.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A child’s sexual activity appears too advanced for his or her age.</strong> &nbsp;Example: We would not expect to discover a 7-year-old engaged in anal intercourse. This behavior would be of concern to us because we would wonder how a child so young would even have knowledge of this kind of activity.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A child continues to engage in sexual activities in public.</strong> &nbsp;In this case, the specific activity of a child may be okay, but it is behavior that should occur only in private. Example: It may not be unusual for a 17-year-old boy to masturbate, but we would not expect him to do it publicly in a shopping mall.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sexual behavior occurs with other children who are not the child’s friends or peers. </strong>Children and youth usually choose other children who they know and have an on-going relationship with when they explore or engage in sexual activities. It is unusual for children to engage in sexual activities with strangers or those they do not know well.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A child is preoccupied with sex to the exclusion of other activities. </strong>If sexual activities seem to be the central part of the child’s life or the child appears to be “driven” to engage in sexual acts, this needs attention.</li><li><strong>A child’s sexual activity causes physical or emotional pain to self or others.&nbsp;</strong> Example: We expect a 6-year-old may masturbate, but it is not usual to do this until he or she bleeds.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A child engages in sexual activity with children who are younger, smaller, less mature, or somehow more vulnerable. </strong>We expect healthy sexual activity to be among friends or peers of the same age, size, developmental level, etc. If a child is in any position to take advantage of another child for sexual gain, this is a concern. Example: A child who is baby-sitting for another younger child may have power over the younger child because the baby-sitter is “in charge” and the younger child is expected to obey them.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A child’s sexual behaviors continue after clear and consistent attempts by an adult to intervene or redirect the child to other activities.</strong> If the behavior seems to be out of the child’s control, or if they refuse to change their behavior, this may be a sign of a problem.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Expressions of anger frequently accompany a child’s sexual behavior.</strong> Children with sexual behavioral problems often learn to use sex to express their anger. Patterns of expressing anger through sex are scary and dangerous and need to be stopped.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A child uses tricks, games, promises, threats, or force to get another child to be sexual. </strong>Sexually abusive children can be very clever at getting another child to cooperate with them and have sex. They will fool them into going along with them or threaten them if they try to tell anybody.</li></ul>\n  </div>"

They have critical information concerning the history of problems which led to the admission of the child to the hospital. This key information must be shared with the treatment team to plan for the child’s care. Additionally, it is critical that the caregivers remain involved with the child, as this generally helps the child make progress.</p><p>Input from the caregiver is also important in deciding on a discharge plan which meets both the child’s and family’s needs. If the child cannot return to the same family after discharge, it is important for the caregivers, SASS worker and child’s caseworker to plan a meeting prior to discharge for the caregivers to say goodbye and the child to be told where he or she will go to live after leaving the hospital.</p><h4>Supports Available to Facilitate Caregiver’s Involvement &nbsp;</h4><p>SASS has the primary responsibility of facilitating a caregiver’s involvement while a child is in the hospital. SASS can help with transportation, child care and other support which will allow foster caregivers to participate. If you need assistance in participating while the child is in a psychiatric hospital, ask the SASS agency.&nbsp;</p><p>SASS can also connect you with a Family Resource Developer (FRD), which is someone who has also had a child involved in a social service system.

The DCFS nurse can help caregivers access needed health or specialized health care services, understand the actions of medications or interactions of multiple medications a child may be taking, find help in managing specific health conditions in the home, or advocate for in-home services or equipment needed to meet a child’s specific needs. To find your DCFS nurse, call your child’s caseworker or your DCFS regional office.</p><p><strong>Routine Dental Care and Braces:</strong> DentaQuest (888-286-2447) can refer caregivers to dentists and orthodontists statewide who take the child’s medical card. If a child needs braces, he or she must be referred to an orthodontist by a dentist, and both must be Medicaid providers. Vision Screening and Obtaining Eyeglasses: A child’s vision should be checked at the Comprehensive Health Evaluation during the first 21 days in foster care and periodically thereafter, at well-child checkups. Often schools also test vision. To find information on vision providers that accept the Medicaid card, call the AllKids hotline at 800-226-0768 and select Option 2. AllKids is a state program offering health insurance premiums based on family income and other eligibility requirements. The child’s HealthWorks primary care physician will refer the child to an eye care specialist, if needed.</p><p><strong>Medicine:</strong> Medicine prescribed by a doctor is available for children through any pharmacy registered as a Department of Healthcare and Family Services provider. Take the Illinois medical card with the doctor’s prescription. The pharmacy needs the child’s Illinois medical card as proof of eligibility to receive medicine paid for by the state. The pharmacy will fi ll the prescription and bill DHFS. Nonprescription medicine, such as aspirin or cough syrup, is not covered by the medical card. Caregivers should pay for this by using the monthly board payment they receive.</p><p><em>Exception</em><strong>: Psychotropic medication</strong> is prescribed for the purpose of altering mood, emotion, thought processes, or behavior. Example: Ritalin. When a physician prescribes a psychotropic medication, the caregiver must notify the child’s caseworker. The caseworker is responsible for securing consent for the specific psychotropic medication. The psychotropic medication should not be administered until the consent is approved. Consents for psychotropic medications are valid for no more than 180 days.</p><p><strong>Medical Billing Help: </strong>Caregivers should not receive bills for medical services provided by HealthWorks physicians or other Medicaid providers. If bills are sent in error, contact the child’s caseworker and agency for help. Be sure to provide them with copies of the bill, as well as any other useful documentation. Your caseworker and agency will contact the DCFS Office of Health Services, 217-557-2689, for assistance. Use of a Medicaid-enrolled provider usually eliminates billing problems.</p><p><strong>Support from Private Agency Foster Care Programs: </strong>The foster care private agency should give foster families the agency’s policy and procedure about how to report a child’s emergency and ongoing health and medical needs to the caseworker and agency. Caseworkers and agencies are responsible for taking care of the health/medical needs of each child whose case they manage. Therefore, if the agency cannot find a way to meet the child’s health/medical needs, the agency must ask DCFS for help in obtaining health-related equipment or services for the child.</p>\n  </div>"

If a child has a medical emergency, the physician has the right and responsibility to treat the child without consent of the DCFS guardian.

The child’s caseworker must obtain this consent.</p><p>After business hours, on weekends and holidays consents for emergency medical treatment are provided to medical personnel, in Cook County, by contacting 773-538-8800, or outside of Cook, 217-782-6533.</p><p><strong>Emergency Treatment Away from Home</strong><br>Caregivers taking children out of state or the country must first obtain a signed, written consent from the child’s caseworker.

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>Planning and making successful family visits happen are difficult teamwork tasks for caregivers and caseworkers, but some of the most important. Research has repeatedly confirmed that family visiting is the key to family reunification. If you are fostering a child whose permanency goal indicates a certain, or possible, return home to family, visiting will be an important part of the Service Plan for the family. Visitation as part of reunification is detailed in Chapter 3. Although complicated arrangements and emotions do not make visits easy, the results speak for the value of family visiting.&nbsp;</p><p>Visits are important to consider for all permanency goals. Visits strengthen the connections to the important people in the child’s life. With guidance from caregivers, therapists and caseworkers, visits can help the child sort through complicated feelings and prepare him for emotional changes as he grows older.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why Visits Work&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When a child is removed from home, both the parents and the child feel like failures. Parents frequently feel inadequate and children may feel that somehow the breakup of the family is their fault. When someone from outside the family removes the child, there is trauma and a feeling of loss of control. Visits help to heal the feelings of failure and inadequacy and lay the groundwork for building a better parent-child relationship.</p><p><strong>Dealing with Expectations and Emotion&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Even though everyone wants visits to happen, all parties involved in the visit have different expectations. The feelings surrounding each person’s expectations make emotional balance difficult for everyone — including caseworkers and caregivers.</p><p>Children want to visit family to:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>be reassured they are still loved and lovable;&nbsp;</li><li>know that the parents, siblings and extended family are okay;&nbsp;</li><li>receive permission from the parents to be happy where he or she is living until returning home is possible; and&nbsp;</li><li>ease the pain of separation, loss and grief.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Parents want to visit children to:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>be reassured that the child is cared for;&nbsp;</li><li>reassert their commitment to the child;&nbsp;</li><li>know that the child has not forgotten them;&nbsp;</li><li>be informed about the child’s growth and development; and&nbsp;</li><li>become better at parenting.</li></ul><p>Caregivers attending visits expect to:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>keep in touch with changes in the family impacting the permanency plan;&nbsp;</li><li>better understand the child’s relationship to the parents, to better understand the child; and&nbsp;</li><li>provide support to the child in his or her effort to understand the situation and to help the child cope.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Caseworkers have the primary responsibility in making visits happen by:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>&nbsp;working with the parents, caregivers, and child, when appropriate, to set up a visitation schedule that follows DCFS rules and the case plan;&nbsp;</li><li>supervising the visit or making arrangements if supervised visits are necessary;&nbsp;</li><li>recording clinical observations of what happened during the visit, such as parent-child interaction, etc.; and&nbsp;</li><li>reporting about visits to the juvenile court.</li></ul><p>Sometimes visits do not go well and children return to the foster home disappointed. &nbsp;If the visiting plan or the visit doesn’t satisfy everyone’s hopes and expectations, emotions are likely to be running high. The caseworker has the stress of dealing with everyone’s emotions, while caregivers may be left with a very disappointed, sad and/or angry child acting out his feelings. Even if the results of a visit do not seem positive at the moment, every visit is a positive step toward the child reaching a permanent family.</p><p><strong>Place, Frequency and Length of Visits&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When the permanency goal is return home, a visiting plan must be established within three working days after placement outside the home unless the placement was an emergency. In emergency placement, the visiting plan must be established within 10 working days after placement.&nbsp;</p><p>Parents are expected to visit at least weekly unless there is a documented reason. Visits are to be in the parents’ home if consistent with the safety and well-being of the child. If visits cannot be in the parents’ home, they are to be in the most homelike setting possible. Length of visits should increase unless specific harm to the child is caused by the visits. Small children may need more frequent visits to remember parents. Older children may need longer visits to see their parents as an important part of their lives.</p><p>Sometimes visits take place at foster homes, if the caseworker agrees and the caregiver is willing to host the visit.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Foster caregivers, DCFS and agencies may not reduce or ask a court to reduce the frequency of visits based on the unavailability of a supervisor for the visits or as a form of discipline</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Sibling Visits&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The caseworker must file a sibling visitation and contact plan with the court within 10 days after the child enters substitute care. &nbsp;Caregivers should help develop the sibling visitation and contact plan. &nbsp;The plan should specify the frequency of visits and approved contact beginning immediately after the children come into DCFS care. The children can also participate in developing the plan. This plan is &nbsp;included in the children’s case plan.</p><p>The visitation and contact plan should specify how long each visit should last, include the location and supervision to be provided for visits, list approved contact that the children may have between visits and times of day when that contact may occur (for example, aft er school, &nbsp;etc.). A brief statement of the reasons for selecting the frequency and length of the visits and type of approved contacts should also be recorded in the case plan.</p><p>DCFS or agencies are responsible for scheduling and providing visits among all siblings placed apart at least twice per month, <em>beginning no later than two weeks after the child comes into temporary custody</em>, unless:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>a court has ordered that sibling visits occur less frequently or not at all; or&nbsp;</li><li>one sibling may physically, mentally, or emotionally harm another during the visit and supervision could not prevent the risk of such harm. This should be determined by prior observation or documentation of their interaction as recorded in the child’s case file and the risk must be documented in the child’s case file.</li></ul><p>The caseworker will identify the child’s siblings and add them to the visitation and contact plan. &nbsp;The child’s siblings may include children/youth:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>living in intact families;&nbsp;</li><li>living in substitute care, including out of state placements;&nbsp;</li><li>in an ILO/TLP, Youth in College, or Placement Alternative Contract living arrangement;&nbsp;</li><li>who are hospitalized;&nbsp;</li><li>residing in group homes or residential placements;&nbsp;</li><li>who have been adopted, even when birth siblings are not adopted together or when one or more siblings remain in care;&nbsp;</li><li>who are under legal guardianship, even when birth siblings are not adopted together or when one or more siblings remain in care;&nbsp;</li><li>who are emancipated; or&nbsp;</li><li>who have attained adulthood.</li></ul><p><strong>Supervising Sibling Visits&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Visits give the caseworker time to make clinical observations necessary to making decisions about services and permanency recommendations. If a caseworker decides not to supervise a visit and supervised visits are required in the case plan, he or she is responsible for obtaining other staff &nbsp;to supervise. Caregivers may be asked by the caseworker to supervise visits if the caseworker feels it is appropriate. The caseworker’s supervisor must approve any person other than the caseworker supervising visits. Caregivers are encouraged to become acquainted with the child’s siblings. &nbsp;This can be easily accomplished by supervising sibling visitation when possible. Caregivers are not required to supervise visits and should agree when they feel comfortable with the situation and know the supervisor has approved. &nbsp;Caregivers can be reimbursed for supervising short and overnight visits. &nbsp;(See Section 9, page 7) Caregivers are encouraged to host sibling visits whenever possible. A reimbursement fee for activities during the visit is available. (See Section 9, page 7)</p><p><strong>Transportation&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The caseworker has the primary responsibility for arranging transportation for visits. Caregivers are encouraged to provide transportation for the children to visit. Reimbursement for mileage may be available. (See Section 9, page 7)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Grandparent Visits&nbsp;</strong></p><p>DCFS encourages visits between grandparents or great-grandparents and children in foster care if it is in the best interest of the child. &nbsp;In cases where the grandparents or great-grandparents have been granted visiting privileges by a divorce court in accordance with the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act (750 ILCS 5/607) DCFS will allow the visits.</p><p><strong>Confidentiality of Foster Caregiver Information</strong></p><p>A foster caregiver’s name, address and phone number cannot be disclosed without prior written notice to the caregiver, according to Illinois law (CFSA 535.3, effective 7-24-98). &nbsp;The caregiver may request the caseworker not release this information to the child and also has the right to seek a Section 2-25 Order of Protection from the court. A person who has been told the name, address and phone number of the child’s caregiver who knowingly and willfully re-discloses this information is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, according to the new law mentioned above.</p>\n  </div>"

Starting a life book for a child new to foster care, or continuing a life book started by another caregiver, can help a child cope with feelings of grief, loss and separation from family and his former life. &nbsp;The child’s life book should be his to keep if he leaves your home. Classes on life books are available online and in the classroom. Check with your licensing worker or the DCFS Office of Training.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rebuilding the Past&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“<em>Who am I? Where did I come from? What was my first word? What did I look like in kindergarten</em>?” are questions every child asks. For caregivers, answering these questions may not be easy. Working with the child to record past life history in a life book gives her the opportunity to tell you about her family and you a chance to record what she says. This insight to the child’s feelings can be very helpful in understanding her current behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>If parents, grandparents or other relatives are available, talk to the caseworker about gathering information and items for the child’s life book related to his past, including: earlier photos, information about his birth (weight, length, day of the week, etc.), photos of his parents, siblings and extended family, first words, age when he took his first step and other developmental milestones. Your notes and gathering of important items and people together in one place may reassure your child that he will not “forget” his family and former life while he is in foster care.</p><p><strong>Recording the Present</strong></p><p>Do not forget to save the present, while you, the foster child and the caseworker are recapturing the past. &nbsp;Ask the child what he wants to save in the life book.

Effective discipline training is available from DCFS and agencies. Your local school district may also offer classes for parents.

The words need to be adapted to the developmental age of the child.</p><h4>Placement is Never a Child’s Fault</h4><p>It is very common for children to blame themselves for what happened to them and what happened to their family. Validate the child’s response to trauma as a normal reaction to what happened. It sometimes helps to have children think about how old or how big they were when the trauma took place that led to placement and that they were too young or too small to really make a difference. Begin to gently help the child understand that while they may want to believe that they could have prevented the trauma or saved their mother, father, siblings, etc., even the grown-ups in their family weren’t able to do this.</p><h4>Help for Parents</h4><p>Children need to hear how their parents are being helped to do whatever is necessary to reunite and provide the safety, nurturance, and guidance all children need. If parents are missing, children need to hear how service providers are working to search for them and help them once they are found.</p><h4>Involvement in Service Planning</h4><p>Older children can participate in information gathering and the service planning process. They need clear messages about progress, or how parents or guardians are being helped, what they are doing, the back-up/concurrent plan if parents or guardians can’t or won’t do what’s necessary, time frames, and what children need to be doing day-to-day and in the next few weeks.</p><h4>Time Frames</h4><p>Older children need to hear a clear message of the time frame for working to make their families better, including the timelines dictated by child welfare policy related to the search for permanency.</p><h4>Capacity for Change</h4><p>Older children are busy trying to figure out who they are and how they fi t in the world. They need to understand that their experience with trauma, especially chronic, early trauma that takes place within the context of their family, does not mean that they will grow up to be “just like” those who have hurt them or their family. For example: Just because a child was hit doesn’t mean that he or she will hit their own children.</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <h4>Prior to Placement&nbsp;</h4><p>A Mental Health Screening for <em>every child over 5</em> is included in the Comprehensive Health Evaluation, which is required during the first 21 days in foster care. A “Developmental Screening” is done for every child under 5 years of age. The results of this evaluation should be in the child’s case file. Asking for information about a child’s behavior is important in matching your family’s skills and time to the child’s personal needs and need for behavioral services. If you accept a child with a history of receiving behavioral health services prior to placement in your home, consult with the caseworker to make sure you know exactly what services he is receiving now and what to do if you or the child needs further help.</p><p>Also consider seeking additional training. Several classes are offered in the classroom setting or in digital format to help caregivers increase their skills for taking care of children impacted by trauma or with developmental concerns.</p><h4>When Nothing You Try Works</h4><p>With some children, nothing seems to work. This is not an indication of failure as either a parent or a foster caregiver. The child will persistently “test” your family, the rules of the house, and your patience. Ask yourself, “Is this behavior something I’ve seen before?” and, “Do I feel comfortable managing this behavior on my own?” If the answer is “no,” you should immediately ask the caseworker for services for the child and consultation for yourself. Every child is different. <strong>Caregivers should never be afraid to ask for help if the child’s behavior is unusual or something they have never seen before.</strong> Getting help for the child before a crisis develops will help everyone succeed.</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <h4>Understand Normal Behavioral Development&nbsp;</h4><p>Even experienced parents often forget the normal social, emotional and behavioral patterns of children at different ages. Pages 28-43 of this handbook section provide a quick reference.</p><h4>Uncover the Child’s History&nbsp;</h4><p>Talk to the child’s caseworker about the child’s behavior. Ask about the child’s previous history before coming to your family. Understanding where a child came from and his or her previous reactions and behavior in that environment can provide clues about the current behavior.</p><h4>Look At Your Home Environment&nbsp;</h4><p>A safe, nurturing, and predictable home environment is what every child needs. This type of home environment will go a long way to help any child overcome fear, anxiety, loss, grief and other emotional trauma. Predictability will also help the child who neurologically cannot predict, or whose previous environment was not predictable, understand the “cause and effect” of his or her behavior — “when I do this, I can expect that to happen.”</p><h4>Understand Your Reactions to Problem Behavior</h4><p>We all have a tendency to think a child’s misbehavior in our presence is directed at us. We take it personally. Then we get angry. . .and then we get locked into an emotional power struggle which frustrates everyone involved. Many children in foster care often act out angrily because, in their previous environment, acting out angrily is the only thing that got a consistent response. When they were being good and fairly well-behaved, they were being ignored. Once any caregiver realizes that the child is not personally out to make them angry — it’s just the child’s attempt to create some “cause and effect” — the caregiver can stop reacting emotionally.</p><p>Not taking it personally allows the caregiver to be a good observer of what triggers the child’s behavior and allows him or her to work with the child objectively. Think about your own history and try to identify circumstances and specific behaviors that serve as triggers for your anger. Acknowledge that the child may act out in a specific way because he or she knows what response it will elicit from you. Taking a moment to separate feelings about matters unrelated to the child’s behavior will make it easier to observe and learn from the child’s reaction.</p><h4>Identify What “Triggers” Problem Behavior</h4><p>There is always a reason for problem behavior. Usually the reasons can be identified by a good observer. When a child displays problem behavior, think about what was happening before the behavior took place. Look for a pattern. For example, you may see a pattern of destructive behavior following visits or a phone call from the child’s relatives. Or, your child may always react to going to school or to bed. Sometimes, the “triggers” occur just before the bad behavior happens. Other times, the “trigger” may be more remote, like the day or week before. Being a good observer can help you make a good guess about the “trigger” to the bad behavior.</p><h4>Bring Trigger Events to Your Child’s Attention — Listen to Every Explanation</h4><p>Remember: not every “trigger” to behavior is readily observable. For example, a child may be emotional after hearing a song on the radio that evokes a memory. This type of “trigger” is very difficult to spot and usually can only be identified when the child talks about it. After the event, ask the child about what “triggered” the behavior. Questions like, “What were you thinking right before you got angry?” may allow the child to connect his or her feelings with the behavior and give you helpful information. After a behavioral outburst, when things are calm, discuss the behavior with the child. Point out your observation about what “triggered” the bad behavior and ask him or her to share in finding a solution. Example: “I’ve noticed that when I say to you that it’s bedtime, you usually seem to have a hard time. Is there anything we can do together to help you when it’s time for bed?”</p><p>By bringing these observations to the child’s attention, you are helping the child understand the cause and effect of his own behavior. You are also showing your desire to help. By asking the child why bedtime is difficult, you are getting information which will help solve the problem. In this example, it could be as simple as the child being afraid of the dark, with a night-light being a solution to the problem.</p><h4>Try Not to Label a Child’s Behavior</h4><p>It is easy to slip into the habit of using labels to describe a child. For example, you may think a child is “depressed” and communicate that to a therapist. “Depressed” has different meanings to different people. If you can observe behavior, and describe it to the intervention team or therapist, it is more helpful. Example: “Darryl seems withdrawn and overly shy. He stays in his room for most of the day and doesn’t have a good appetite. He acts sad and doesn’t want to play with other kids.” will be more helpful than saying “Darryl is depressed.”</p><h4>Log Behavior to Help Pinpoint the Problem</h4><p>Keeping a log of your observations of a child’s behavior can help identify what triggers the problem. Record the circumstances under which your child’s problem behavior occurs over time. Your behavioral log will help you and any therapist or counselor more quickly separate “common” behavior associated with the trauma of abuse, neglect and foster care from behavior related to severe emotional disturbance.</p><p>A log is also helpful in measuring progress. If a child starts by acting out 15 times a day, and through logging events you see that the behavior has dropped to five times a day, you are clearly making good progress. This specific information is also much more helpful to a therapist instead of commenting, “He does this all day long!”</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>After a child is placed in foster care, the question is not <em>whether</em> he or she will react to placement, but <em>how</em> and <em>when</em> the child will react. Here are some general comments on normal reactions.</p><p>All children in foster care will have some angry and sad feelings due to past experiences, or low self-esteem and will be in the process of grieving at being separated from their families. These feelings may come out in behaviors directed at you simply because you are there. Don’t take misbehavior personally. It is important to remember that any child placed in any foster home is:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>dealing with feelings about having been a victim of abuse or neglect;</li><li>working through the separation from family or other foster family;</li><li>coping with the separation from friends, relatives, neighbors, and, sometimes, a neighborhood community;</li><li>adjusting to a new foster family;</li><li>having concerns about going to a new school; and</li><li>worrying about making new friends.</li></ul><p>Putting yourself in the child’s shoes can help you understand when a little extra attention and support might be just what is needed to help the child adjust. How would you react to being separated from all of your natural supports— home, job, family and friends—overnight? Your feelings of sadness, nervousness about your new living arrangement, uncertainty about new roommates, stress related to moving your belongings, and apprehension about a new job are much the same as what a foster child feels moving into a new foster family.</p><p>Many children have a relatively mild reaction to their new placement. They may be shy and withdrawn, or slow to warm-up to your kindness and help. Or, they may react by being overly friendly and compliant. There may be occasional verbal outbursts in response to frustration, and they may resist going to school or taking part in activities. But, this child will typically respond to your consistent parenting skills, caring attitude, support and understanding. Other children, especially children who have experienced previous foster care placements, are more likely to show their reaction to being placed in foster care with behaviors that will test your patience and parenting abilities. Based on past experiences, these children may enter your home with an expectation that this placement may not work either and that they may fail. They may also anticipate that sooner or later you will reject and get rid of them. When you respond to their behavior with kindness and understanding, they may test you by pushing limits and creating situations which are intended to make you act in a way which they expect, based on their past experiences.</p><h4>Typical Patterns of Behavior at Placement</h4><p>Behaviors at placement can follow two typical patterns. For instance, the child may start off with problematic behavior and, generally, after a fairly short period of time, the caregivers will see both the frequency and intensity of the behavior starting to decline.&nbsp;</p><p>As a second pattern, the child is withdrawn at fi rst, and then begins to act out after a few days, so his or her behavior actually gets worse. Younger children may have emotional outbursts, run around like a hurricane, or be withdrawn or crying in a corner. The older child may be more subtle or more angry and may be focused on intentionally trying to destroy something or aggravate someone.</p><p>Not understanding why they are separated from their family, experiencing a feeling of loss or loss of control in their lives, or just being afraid and reacting angrily can create either of these patterns or other problematic behavior at placement. Many of these children will eventually respond to your patient and consistent parenting and adjust to being placed with your family. It just might take a little longer.</p>\n  </div>"

The purpose of the review is to assure the case plans are family-focused and move children toward a lifelong relationship that ensures safety and provides for their well being. DCFS Rule 316 outlines the ACR process.</p><p>The case review is conducted by an Administrative Case Reviewer, who is independent of the supervisor and caseworker and, therefore, not responsible for the case direction, management or the delivery of services. The reviewer may raise issues not addressed in the service plan. These issues may be family services or system obstacles that are hindering progress in the case. Based on the caseworker’s response to these issues and best social work practice, the reviewer may advise the caseworker to include or delete information and/or services in the service plan.</p><h4>Foster Caregiver Role in the ACR</h4><p>Foster caregivers can and should make every effort to attend the ACR to add to the discussion, stay in informed and advocate as needed. Caregivers usually have important first-hand information about:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>the wishes and opinions of children under 12 years old who are not usually asked to attend, or older children who cannot attend;</li><li>the quality of services being provided;</li><li>services in the service plan not being provided;</li><li>the need for new services not in the service plan; and</li><li>whether or not the above information was used by the caseworker to develop the service plan</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>Timing of ACRs</strong><br>Temporary Custody Hearing<br>1st ACR ________ 90 days<br>(Within 6 months of the Temporary Custody Hearing)<br>Following the 6-month review, ACRs are conducted every 6 months thereafter</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Foster caregivers will receive a notice of the date for an upcoming ACR. If that date or time is not one where the caregiver could attend, ask for another option. The caregiver’s input is needed in the child’s portion of the ACR for the reviewer to have an accurate view of the case. Caregivers may be present during the child’s portion of the review, but, due to confidentiality, cannot be present for the parent portion of the ACR without the parent’s consent.</p><h4>What is Reviewed at the ACR?</h4><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>whether DCFS’ continuing intervention is necessary;</li><li>whether services, including placement services, are necessary, relevant, coordinated and appropriate, and whether they address the health and safety needs of the child;</li><li>whether or not other services are needed, but are not being provided to the child or family and the reasons why they are not being provided;</li><li>the disability status of a child to ascertain the need for and/or appropriateness of specialized services;</li><li>the appropriateness of the child’s educational placement and the child’s educational progress;</li><li>the child’s health information and family health information which could impact the child;</li><li>special physical, psychological, educational, medical, emotional, or other needs of the child or his family that are relevant to a permanency or placement determination;</li><li>programs or services for any child 16 or over that will enable the child to prepare for independent living;</li><li>compliance of DCFS, service providers, the family, the caregiver (or other substitute care provider) with the&nbsp;</li><li>service plan and, if they are not complying, whether changes in the service plan or goals are needed;</li><li>whether there is progress to resolve the child’s and family’s problems, whether the progress is satisfactory and whether the child can safely return home;</li><li>whether the projected month for achieving the permanency goal is realistic; and</li><li>the appropriateness of the permanency goal and recommended changes to the goal, if appropriate.</li></ul><h4>Outcomes of the ACR</h4><p>The outcomes of each ACR are:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>an objective, independent evaluation of progress towards permanency;</li><li>an objective, independent review of the service plan for the next period; and</li><li>report of the findings and recommendations regarding the case progress toward permanency for the child.</li></ul><p>After reviewing the case, the administrative case reviewer reports their findings and recommendations to those persons who can implement changes in the case and/or the child welfare system.</p><p>The report includes:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>any issues not addressed in the service plan that were discovered during the review;</li><li>family service problems or system issues that are hindering the progress and/or permanency of the case; and</li><li>systemic issues identified in the child welfare system.</li></ul><p>The program operations supervisor is responsible for addressing problems presented in the administrative case reviewer’s report on specific case issues.&nbsp;</p><p>The reviewer may not change a permanency goal established by the court.</p><h4>Who Participates in ACRs?</h4><p>The caseworker and/or supervisor with case responsibility for the children and/or the family are required to attend.&nbsp;</p><p>Others who may attend are:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>parents and their representatives (Unless they are known to be violent and potentially dangerous to other participants in the ACR or their rights have been terminated by the court);</li><li>children 12 years or older, with consideration given to the material in the review and the benefits of having them present.

Success with unsupervised day visits pave the way for unsupervised overnight visits. When safety and responsibility have been demonstrated in overnight and weekend visits and progress continues in services, it is time to prepare for a permanency staffing. A permanency staffing will be held by nine months in all cases. When the parent is prepared to assume full time parenting responsibilities, a reunification support plan will be put together with the participation of service providers and the Child and Family Team. Safety assessments immediately before and shortly after return home will be accompanied by frequent in-person contact of the caseworker with the family and service providers. Caregivers may be part of this team. The case must remain open for the provision of stabilization services and safety monitoring for at least six to eight months after return home.</p><h4>After the Child Returns Home</h4><p>Continuing the relationship after return home may be especially important for early reunification families. These families will have increased visits from<br>caseworkers and other supports as their children return to them. Cases may be open for as long as a year after the families reunify. Caregivers who have worked closely with the family toward reunification celebrate the return of the children with the family, but the celebration may be bittersweet as loss of the children in their home may be difficult for<br>caregivers who have become attached to the children. The work that they have done together may point the way to an ongoing role for the caregiver in the stabilization of the newly reunified family.</p><h4>If Return Home is Not Possible</h4><p>To learn about what happens when safe reunification is not possible and the permanency goal is changed to prepare for adoption, guardianship or independent living, refer to the After Foster Care section in Chapter 7 of this handbook</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>Family visits benefit children in care in many ways. Research has found that children who are visited frequently by their parents are more likely to have a better sense of well-being and to adjust well to placement than children who are visited less frequently or not at all. Research has also shown that visiting is strongly associated with family reunification and with shortened length of stay in care and that there is an association between frequent visiting prior to return home and successful reunification.</p><h4>Frequent Visits in a Family Setting</h4><p>The impact of separation on children and parents is severe. Consistent visits can help children and their parents cope with the loss. An immediate visit engages the parent and reassures the child; frequent visits strengthen family bonds; and visits in a family setting provide a safe and effective opportunity to develop parenting skills. Support of early, frequent and consistent visits in a setting that is comfortable for both parents and children may be the most important contribution a caregiver can make to a family’s efforts to get back together.</p><h4><strong>What is a Family Setting?</strong></h4><p>Family setting means the home of the caregiver, parent, relative, friend or a church or community institution that offers an appropriate environment for parenting activities such as help with homework, hobbies, meal preparation, grooming, chores, getting ready for nap or bedtime. If a parent is hospitalized, in a residential treatment facility or incarcerated, then a visit in the visiting room of the institution is a family setting for that parent and child.</p><h4>Role of the Parent in a Visit in Your Home</h4><p>A parent visiting a child in your home is there as your guest at your invitation and must comply with rules that you, the parent and the caseworker have agreed to before the visits in your home begin. Model rules are available to your caseworker on the DCFS D-Net. These rules may be modified to suit your particular situation.</p>\n  </div>"

The type and extent of shared parenting activities will grow as the parent is successful in changing the conditions that brought the child into care.

Acceptance by the caregiver and assurance that the caregiver will not stand between the parent and child can go a long way to get the work of reunification off to a good start.</p><p><br><strong>Exchange of information about the child</strong></p><p>The parents help the caseworker and caregiver learn about their child. The parents share the “Let Me Tell You About My Child” document with the caregiver, telling the caregiver about the child’s daily routines, habits, likes and dislikes. The caregiver talks with the parents about how the child is doing in foster care. This exchange of information about the child and shared concern for his well-being continues throughout the time that the child is in care.</p><p><br><strong>Shared parenting</strong></p><p>Shared parenting is both a right and a responsibility of the parent. With shared parenting the parent engages in certain parenting tasks together with the caregiver or caseworker. Shared parenting begins with the parent participating in the initial tasks of settling the child in to the new placement – the child health exam, any child psychological evaluations, and meetings at the child’s school. The type and extent of shared parenting tasks grows as the parent becomes successful in changing the conditions that brought the child into care.</p><p><br><strong>Family visits in a family setting</strong></p><p>Child welfare research identifies family visits as a critical factor in the achievement of early, safe and stable family reunification. Family visits are most effective in a relaxed and private setting. Caregivers play an important role in successful family visits.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mentoring and modeling with parents</strong></p><p>Most parents look forward to the return of their child. Many, however, need the assistance of a caring, respectful helper and role model. In these cases the caregiver can provide a role model for caring relationships and family cooperation.</p><p>Safety is always a priority for the department. The safety of the foster caregiver and family is also important. No one is asked to enter a situation in which he or she feels in danger. CANTS and LEADS checks, in-depth assessment, and many experiences with the parent are the guide to safety. &nbsp;The caregiver, of course, will be the one to determine if they will go to a parent’s home and whether the parent may come to their home.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, when a foster caregiver accepts the placement of a child new to foster care, he or she should come to the table with a good faith intention to be supportive of the parents’ relationship with the child and to be helpful to the reunification process.</p><p>Building a relationship with the child’s parents can be done in many ways. &nbsp;For all caregivers it should include:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>encouraging parents in their improved parenting skills and relationship with their child; and&nbsp;</li><li>supporting the transition of responsibility from the caregiver to the parent.</li></ul>\n  </div>"

Many foster families begin fostering without plans to adopt and then fall in love with a child who needs a permanent family. Currently, 95 percent of the children adopted out of foster care in Illinois are adopted by their foster caregivers. Knowing your family’s feelings about adoption and working with birth families to help children return home is important to deciding whether or not a prospective child is a good match for your family.</p><p>Each type of case intervention described on pages 14-16 carries a different amount of caregiver involvement in working with families, that could range from no contact to modeling parenting. Understanding which type of case relates to the children in your care will help you define DCFS and agency expectations of your involvement in working with parents or other family. Even if you do not have in-person contact with parents or extended family of the child, your child’s family of origin will always be present in his or her memory or imagination.</p><p><br><strong>Caregivers have a choice in their role&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Not every case will have a goal of reunification and not every caregiver will be suited to support a family with a reunification goal. Licensing workers will have discussions with caregivers about whether they want to be identified as a resource for a case where reunification is the goal. Those who choose to could then sign a self-assessment form and be listed as such in the Foster Home Availability Database. A caregiver who accepts a reunification case is also open to:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>meeting the parents, as soon as possible after the child has been placed;</li><li>exchanging information about the child between the parent, caregiver and caseworker at initial placement and as the case moves forward;</li><li>shared-parenting activities to allow the parent to fulfill certain parenting responsibilities while the child is in care;</li><li>family visits in a family setting, where the caregiver can support or host visits between the parents and the child (in addition to the required<br>sibling visits); and</li><li>mentoring and modeling with parents, with the caregiver serving as a respectful helper and role model to parents on the road to early reunification.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>When a placing worker calls, ASK what the permanency goal is for the child.</strong></p><p>Know and understand the permanency plan and goal for the foster child before you say “Yes!” to a placement. Be realistic about what you want and can handle. If you want to foster only and the child is likely to need a permanent family, based on the permanency goal and the facts of the case, letting the child be placed with your family is not necessarily in the child’s best interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>"

When a child is removed from his family for protective care, the state is legally bound to make efforts to help the parents to correct the conditions that made it unsafe for the child to stay at home. Each child is placed on the pathway to permanency that best suits his or her needs. It is important to remember that no assessment, no matter how thorough, can predict with certainty what the future will hold. The child’s path to permanency may change according to the parents’ progress.</p><p><strong>The Pathway of Early Reunification</strong><br>Early reunification is the pathway for the child whose family is ready to begin working toward the changes needed to safely parent. The goal is to return the child home as soon as safety can be managed, which may be before the parent has completed treatment or services. Progress is the watchword, not perfection. The family will receive ongoing agency support after return home. The child on the pathway of early reunification needs a caregiver who will have a supportive personal relationship with his parents.</p><p><br><strong>The Pathway of Concurrent Planning</strong><br>Concurrent planning is the pathway for the child whose family has issues or conditions that make reunification especially challenging or who is not ready to start working on needed changes right away. Simply put, concurrent planning means the agency works toward two goals at one time, so that if one goal does not work out, the other can be implemented. For example, the child welfare team work to reunify a child with his or her family, while also exploring adoption. If the child is unable to return to the family, then adoption efforts will already be<br>underway.</p><p>The concurrent planning process focuses on the parent’s actual behavior rather than promises or intentions, allowing the case to move forward if reasonable progress has not been made by a specific time. Concurrent planning ensures decisions concerning permanency are based on a child’s sense of time and urgency. To be done successfully, concurrent planning requires the respectful use of full disclosure, which is open, honest and complete communication between the parents, foster caregivers and child welfare workers.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Pathway of Expedited Termination of Parental Rights</strong><br>The pathway of expedited termination of parental rights is used only when a court determines that the abuse or neglect has been so severe that parental rights should be terminated without agency efforts to help the parents reunify the family. These are extraordinary cases of severe maltreatment that meet criteria set out in state and federal law. Very few situations meet these criteria. The child on the pathway of expedited termination of parental rights needs a caregiver who is committed to adoption or guardianship.</p>\n  </div>"

Foster caregivers must be willing and able to: 1) support the parents by working directly with them to model parenting 2) work as a professional member of the child welfare team and, 3) consider adopting if the child cannot return home.</span></p>\n  </div>"

Under these serious, traumatic circumstances, the adults involved in the care of the child have to operate as a team to minimize the lasting harm, help the child heal and maintain connections with siblings, family members and other important relationships. Foster care is not intended to be a permanent living arrangement. Instead, it provides a way to protect and nurture a child, until he or she can safely return home to parents who are ready to regain that responsibility. When that can’t happen, foster families can help to establish permanency through adoption or guardianship or support an older youth moving toward independence. No matter the goal, it takes commitment and teamwork to make decisions that will lead to the best outcomes for a child.

However, licensed foster homes are either supported directly by a DCFS regional foster care program or by one of many private agencies that have contracts to provide foster care services. DCFS foster families will have a licensing worker who is a DCFS employee. Private agencies support families with their own staﬀ. As another reference point, if your board check comes from your agency, you are a private agency foster parent. DCFS foster parents receive board checks from the state.</span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Is it better to be a DCFS or a private agency foster family?</span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Every agency with a foster care program, including DCFS, maintains supports for its own foster families which are unique to that agency. Agencies also have contracts with DCFS to provide diﬀerent types of foster care (i.e. regular, treatment, specialized, etc.) Prospective foster families should talk to a number of agencies with foster care programs to make an informed decision as to which agency provides supports and programs which match their needs, interests and special skills.</span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">If I am a private agency foster parent, can I transfer my license to another agency or to DCFS?</span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Yes, but the new agency or DCFS must accept your transfer. Consider your reasons for wanting to transfer. If you are dissatisfied with services provided by the agency, be sure your complaints have been heard by the agency’s administration, not just the caseworker.

DCFS’ proposed rules are published in the Illinois Register. This publication begins a 45-day period in which the public may comment on them in writing or through public hearings.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">After the 45-day comment period, DCFS submits the proposed rules to the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules (JCAR) for approval. This legislative committee determines, among other things, whether DCFS has the authority to adopt the proposed rules, whether the rules carry out the intent of the law, and whether DCFS followed the proper process. After JCAR completes its review and indicates that it has no objection to the rules, DCFS is free to adopt them by filing certified copies with the Secretary of State and again publishing the rules in the Illinois Register. This time they are filed as adopted rules. Rules may also be adopted by DCFS on an emergency basis when DCFS determines that a situation poses a threat to the public interest, safety, or welfare.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Rules adopted under the procedure described above are known as “administrative law” and have the same force and effect as laws enacted by the Illinois General Assembly. They are equally binding on DCFS and the public. Once adopted, rules are distributed to DCFS staff , agency service providers, and other interested parties. They are also posted online for public access.</span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Confidentiality of Draft Rules&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you are a foster caregiver belonging to an advisory group, you may be asked to review DCFS policy drafts that are not yet ready for review by the general public.
