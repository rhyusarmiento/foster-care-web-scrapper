The determination of whether a child has been deprived of parental support in the home of removal is made in relation to the child’s natural or adoptive parents.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Parental deprivation exists when the home of removal is:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">1. &nbsp; a non-parent home, because the child is cared for by relatives;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">2. &nbsp; a one-parent home because of:</p><ul><li><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;the death of a parent; or</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;the absence of a parent from the home.</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">3. &nbsp; a two-parent home with:</p><ul><li><p dir=\"ltr\">physical or mental incapacity of at least one parent; or</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">underemployment of the primary wage earner.</p></li></ul><p class=\"text-align-right\" dir=\"ltr\">45 CFR §233.90(a)(1)</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Who are the child’s parents?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The parent-child relationship is established between a child and:</p><ul><li><p dir=\"ltr\">the mother by proof of her having given birth to the child;</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">an adoptive parent by proof of adoption;</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">the father by legal presumption, proof of relationship, court adjudication, or acknowledgment of paternity.</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>When is a man legally presumed to be the child’s father?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">By statute, a man is presumed to be the child’s natural father under any of the following circumstances:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">1. &nbsp; He and the child’s mother were married in apparent compliance with the law (even if the marriage is or could be voided), BEFORE the child’s birth and the child was born while they were married or before the 301st day after the marriage ended.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">2. &nbsp; He and the mother married in apparent compliance with the law (even if the marriage is or could be voided) AFTER the child’s birth, he voluntarily asserted paternity, and:</p><ul><li><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;his assertion of paternity is in a record filed with the Bureau of Vital Statistics;</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">he agreed to be named as the child’s father on the child’s birth certificate; or</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">he promised in a record to support the child as his own.</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">3. &nbsp; He continuously resided in the same household where the child resided during the first two years of the child’s life, and he represented to others that the child was his own.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">4. &nbsp; He is adjudicated, or determined by a court order, to be the child’s father.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">5. &nbsp; He executes an acknowledgment of paternity, in accordance with Texas Family Code&nbsp;§160.302, which must be signed under penalty of perjury by both him and the child’s mother. An acknowledgment of paternity is void when another presumed father, who meets one of the presumed father criteria above, exists, unless the presumed father has signed a denial of his paternity.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Common Law Marriage</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The marriages referred to above include common law marriage. A common law marriage exists if a man and woman:</p><ul><li><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;are both free to marry;</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">live together; and</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">hold out to the public that they are husband and wife.</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">If the common law couple separates and ceases living together, there must be a suit for proof of marriage filed within two years after the separation or the law presumes that the common law marriage never existed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stepparents</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Stepparents include men who marry the child’s mother but do not assert paternity or promise financial responsibility for the child. A stepparent is not a legal parent to the child without adoption.</p><h4 dir=\"ltr\">One-Parent Household</h4><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is continued absence from the home?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">A parent’s absence is considered to be&nbsp;continued absence from the home when:</p><ul><li><p dir=\"ltr\">the nature of the absence is such that there is an interruption or termination of the parent’s functioning as a provider of maintenance, physical care, or guidance for the child; and</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">the known or indefinite duration of the absence precludes counting on a parent’s performance of the function of planning for the present support or care of the child.</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">As long as these two conditions are met, the parent may be absent for any reason and may have only left recently. Deprivation includes any absence that prevents the family from relying on the missing parent’s support or care of the child. This can occur for many reasons, including divorce, separation, desertion, incarceration, deportation, or hospitalization. Absence for active military duty does not constitute&nbsp;continued absence from the home.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Active Military Duty</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">A parent who is absent solely by reason of the performance of active duty in the uniformed services of the United States is not considered&nbsp;continually absent from the home.</p><p class=\"text-align-right\" dir=\"ltr\">45 CFR §233.90(c)(iii)</p><h4 dir=\"ltr\">Two-Parent Household</h4><p dir=\"ltr\">How is physical or mental incapacity established?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For a parent to be considered incapacitated, the existence of a physical or mental defect, illness, or impairment must be supported by a medical diagnosis that is verified by a physician’s statement. The incapacity must be so debilitating as to reduce substantially or eliminate the parent’s ability to support or care for child. The incapacity must be expected to last for at least 30 days. The parent’s receipt of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI) based on a disability or blindness is also acceptable proof of incapacity.</p><p class=\"text-align-right\" dir=\"ltr\">45 CFR §233.90(c)(1)(iv)</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How is underemployment of the primary wage earner established?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">If a child is living with both parents, deprivation exists when the primary wage earner (PWE) parent is underemployed. The PWE is the parent who had the most earned income in the previous two years. The parents can identify which of them is the PWE based upon this criterion. The PWE is considered “underemployed” when:</p><ul><li><p dir=\"ltr\">the PWE is working less than 100 hours per month;</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">the PWE is averaging less than 100 hours per month, if working intermittently, or</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">he PWE’s monthly gross income does not exceed the income limit for the size of the certified group, as listed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fostercaresystems.byu.edu/rules/TX/220\">Appendix 1530-D</a>: Income Guidelines for Underemployed Parent for Parental Deprivation.</p></li></ul><p class=\"text-align-right\" dir=\"ltr\">45 CFR §233.100</p><h4 dir=\"ltr\">Examples and Special Situations</h4><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Unwed Parents Living Together</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">If a child lives with the mother and the biological father, who admits paternity but is not the child’s legally presumed father, the eligibility specialist determines deprivation as follows:</p><ul><li><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;If mother is or was married (other than by common law) to another man whom the law presumes to be the child’s legal father, then the child is deprived based on absence from the home of the man whom the law recognizes as the child’s father.</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;If the mother was married by common law to another man at the time the child was conceived, but at least two years have passed without the filing of suit for proof of their marriage after the common law couple separated and ceased living together, there is no presumed father and deprivation does not exist.</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;If there is no other man whom the law presumes to be the child’s father, then the child can only be deprived by:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p dir=\"ltr\">parental incapacity, or&nbsp;</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">underemployment of either the mother or biological father who are living together, whichever is the primary wage earner (PWE).</p></li></ul></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Unwed Parents – Paternity Uncertain</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">If the child’s paternity is uncertain, the eligibility specialist determines parental deprivation as follows:</p><ul><li><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;If a child is living with the mother and a man who may be the child’s natural father, but the couple disagrees about paternity, and there is no legally presumed father, then there is insufficient basis upon which to reach a conclusion regarding deprivation based on absence from the home. If deprivation cannot be established by incapacity or underemployment, the case would be certified state-paid and monitored for the court determination regarding paternity. Once there is an adjudication of paternity, the case must be reviewed again for deprivation now that the legal father has been established. If the man that was living in the home at the time of the child’s removal is adjudicated to be the child’s father, then deprivation cannot exist by reason of absence from the home.</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">If a child is living with the mother and a man who both agree is NOT child’s natural parent, and there is no legally presumed father, then child is deprived.</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Active Military Service</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">If the father is on active military service overseas, the eligibility specialist determines parental deprivation as follows:</p><ul><li><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;If a child is living only with the mother, but the father would be present in the home if he were not on active military service overseas, then the child is not deprived because of parental absence. When the sole reason why a mother or father is not in the home is because of active military service, then that parent is not considered absent.</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\">If child is living with mother and biological father, but the mother is married to a man who is in military service, there is no deprivation.</p></li></ul><h4 dir=\"ltr\">Tool for Determining Deprivation</h4><div dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><table><tbody><tr><td><p dir=\"ltr\">If child is removed from the mother and mother is:</p></td><td><p dir=\"ltr\">Then:</p></td><td><p dir=\"ltr\">Action</p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir=\"ltr\">1. &nbsp; living with biological father of the child AND:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;• &nbsp; the biological father agrees he is the father of the child, AND:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;• &nbsp; the mother is still legally married to another man outside the home who is the legally presumed father…</p></td><td><p dir=\"ltr\">the child is deprived because the mother’s husband is considered the child’s father, and is absent from the home.</p></td><td><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir=\"ltr\">2. &nbsp; living with biological father of the child AND:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;• &nbsp; the biological father agrees he is the father of the child, AND:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;• &nbsp; there is no legally presumed father…</p></td><td><p dir=\"ltr\">the child does not meet deprivation based on absence from the home.</p></td><td><p dir=\"ltr\">The foster care eligibility specialist must determine whether the parents meet deprivation based on the criteria for disability.

First priority is to maintain a child safely at home. However, if a child cannot safely remain at home, kinship care has the potential for providing these elements of permanency by virtue of the kin's knowledge of and relationship to the family and child.</div><div>(2) Kinship work is done in the context of a child and family team. Kinship care includes elements of child protection, in-home services, family preservation, and out-of-home care. When a child cannot safely remain home, kinship care is preferable to other out-of-home placements if the kinship caregiver can keep the child safe and appropriately meet the child's needs.</div><div>(3) The caregiver's willingness and ability to care for and keep the child safe are fundamental. The kinship caregiver must have or acquire knowledge of the child, be able to meet the child's needs, support reunification efforts, and be able to provide the child access to parents, siblings, and other family members through visits or caring for the child and siblings as a group.</div><div>(4) Ongoing assessment of the child's safety, permanence, and well-being is important to the stability and value of kinship care. Ongoing assessment of safety is based on the components of safety decision-making, which include threats of harm, vulnerabilities of the child, and protective capacities of the kinship caregiver and their support system.</div><div>(5) Providing for kinship care in the Child and Family Services spectrum of services requires due diligence to identify and locate kin families with whom children may form or continue relationships at home or in temporary or permanent placements. Support to kinship caregivers is essential to the success of the child's placement with the family and to the family's ability to respond to the needs of the child. As members of the child and family team, kinship caregivers will receive support from other family members and from informal and formal supports to provide for the child</div><p>Page 1</p>\n  </div>"

Options for temporary relief include paid respite, non-paid respite, child care, and incidental care.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Applicable Law<br>Utah Code Ann. §80-2-301. Division responsibilities.</p><p>Definitions:<br>A. Incidental Care: Occasional care, not in excess of five hours per week and never including overnight stays. Examples of this would be babysitting for five hours or less per week or transporting the child on behalf of the foster parent for a duration of time totaling less than five hours per week. Incidental care does not have to take place in the out-of-home caregiver’s home</p><p>B. Child care: Ongoing care to the child in the out-of-home caregiver’s home on a continual, regular basis (such as when the out-of-home caregiver is at work), OR care for a child in out-of-home care in excess of five hours a week. Child care does not include overnight stays with the child.</p><p>C. Respite care: Any arrangement that requires the individual caring for the child to stay with the child overnight. It may also be for multiple overnight stays. A person providing respite care in their own home for a child in foster care must be a licensed foster care provider and may not exceed the capacity they are licensed for. However, an unlicensed person may provide respite care for a child in foster care in the home of the out-of-home caregiver, as long as the requirements outlined below are met.</p><p>D. Other options for temporary relief:</p><ol><li>Family-time with the child’s non-licensed relative in order to maintain connections. [See: Kinship Practice Guidelines Section <a href=\"/foster/ut-utah-department-health-and-human-services-division-children-and-family-services-157\">502.3a</a> for requirements for unsupervised access to a child in care.]</li><li>In rare instances where the Child and Family Team has explored all other options and consulted with the RFC and there is still a need, babysitting outside of the licensed foster home over the five hours may occur. The OL will require a variance [see: Admin. Rule <a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/p5799jc5ikir8isxjilp27j0fsqvvv5w\">R501-12-5(9)</a>] and complete the background check. DCFS will complete a safety walk-through of the home using the DCFS KBS16 Limited Home Inspection checklist.</li></ol><p>E. “Short-term relief care provider” means an individual who provides short-term and temporary relief care to a foster parent:</p><ol><li>for less than six consecutive nights;</li><li>in the short-term relief care provider's home;</li><li>is an immediate family member or relative, as those terms are defined in UtahCode Ann. §80-3-102, of the foster parent;</li><li>is direct access qualified, as that term is defined in Utah Code Ann. §26B-2-120;</li><li>has been approved to provide short-term relief care by DCFS;</li><li>is not reimbursed by DCFS for the temporary relief care provided; and</li><li>is not an immediate family member or relative, as those terms are defined in Utah Code Ann. §80-3-102, of the foster child.</li></ol><p>F. Emergency Care: Care provided to a child in out-of-home care, when an approved child care or respite provider is not available, which enables the out-of-home caregiver to respond to an urgent situation. Emergency care can only be provided when there is a death, hospitalization, or serious illness of the out-of-home caregiver or anyone in the caregiver’s immediate family; or when another child placed in the caregiver’s home has attempted or succeeded in seriously harming themselves or others.</p><p>Practice Guidelines<br>A. Respite care is used to provide short-term relief for the out-of-home caregiver from the responsibilities of caring for a child in foster care. It may include multiple occurrences of overnight care. Respite care may be paid or non-paid and may be provided for any child who is in the custody of DCFS.</p><ol><li>For children placed with contracted providers, the contract agency is responsible for making arrangements for respite care and to comply with respite care requirements outlined in their contract.</li><li>Prior approval must be obtained from the caseworker or Resource Family Consultant (RFC) when an out-of-home caregiver chooses to make arrangements for respite care.</li><li>The respite caregiver must meet the qualifications of a respite provider (outlined below) in order to provide respite care for children in care.</li></ol><p>B. Respite care may be provided in the following ways:</p><ol><li>The temporary placement of a foster child with another licensed out-of-home provider that is not the primary out-of-home caregiver for the child. The licensed home must be pre-approved by the RFC. A placement made for respite purposes is meant to be short term (12 days or less) with the intent that the child will return to the current foster home and does not count as a placement change for the child. If an out-of-home caregiver requests respite care for a duration of time over 12 days (such as for a longer vacation or for other extenuating circumstances), the request will be staffed with the RFC supervisor or other region designee and, if approved, the approval will be documented in the activity logs for the case and the provider notes. It must still be the intent that the child will return to the current foster home for a respite placement over 12 days to be approved.</li><li>Temporary placement of a foster child in a licensed facility, with the intent that the child will return to the current foster home.</li><li>Overnight care in the home of the out-of-home caregiver by an individual certified by DCFS as an In-home Respite caregiver (see requirements in paragraph F below).</li><li>Temporary care in the home of a state licensed child care provider. The licensed daycare provider must be licensed through the DHHS, Child Care Licensing Program.</li><li>DCFS Paid Respite Care: Respite providers that will be paid by DCFS will be opened under the RE code that corresponds with the level of care that the child is currently placed at for payment.</li><li>If a licensed out-of-home caregiver will be used for respite care but is not approved to provide the level of care that the child is placed at, then the case must be staffed by the RFC or through another regionally approved process prior to the respite occurring, in order to ensure that the provider has the skills necessary to care for that child. If approved to provide respite, the staffing and approval must be documented in the provider notes in SAFE and the required payment approvals (under the corresponding RE codes) will be opened in order to pay the respite provider the correct amount. The payment will be made using the One Time Payment Form (Form 295).</li><li>Respite care not paid by DCFS: Licensed out-of-home providers may make arrangements to exchange children with another licensed out-of-home caregiver for short periods of time for respite purposes after obtaining approval from the RFC or the child's caseworker. An out-of-home caregiver may directly pay for those services if they desire.</li></ol><p>C. Accrual of DCFS Paid Respite Days:</p><ol><li>All licensed out-of-home caregivers will receive one paid respite day per calendar month for every month they have a child placed in the home. Out-of-home caregivers must have at least one foster child/youth in their home for a period of 15 days during a calendar month to accrue one respite day.</li><li>Regardless of the number of children placed in the home, a maximum of 12 respite days can be accrued by a licensed out-of-home caregiver at any given time. The accrued respite days do not expire and can be used at any time. After accrued respite days have been used, the out-of-home caregiver must re-accrue respite days through the process described in C.1.</li><li>The RFC will document in the provider notes in SAFE the number of paid respite days accrued and used by the out-of-home caregiver a minimum of once every six months. The documentation will coincide with the required RFC face-to-face home visits and at any other time the RFC deems necessary or appropriate.</li></ol><p>D. Extenuating Circumstances for Paid Respite: Though more than 12 days of respite can be approved (see B1), the region director or designee must be consulted if the out-of-home caregiver requests that more than 12 respite days be paid. The region director or designee may approve more than 12 paid respite days in extenuating circumstances. It is up to the region to staff these circumstances and ensure that the situation and approval of respite are documented in the provider notes.</p><p>E. Qualifications of a Respite Caregiver:</p><ol><li>A licensed foster home with openings, or a licensed respite care home/facility. The licensed home is limited to the amount of children they are approved to provide care for on their foster care license. The total number of children in their home, including those they are providing respite for, may not exceed the amount of children they are licensed for unless the home is granted a variance. The licensed home must also be able to meet the child’s needs.</li><li>A state-licensed day care provider. The day care provider must be in compliance with the ratios specified on their child care license.</li><li>In-Home Respite provider. A respite caregiver who is qualified by DCFS to provide care in the out-of-home caregiver's home. An In-Home Respite provider must meet the following requirements:<ol><li>Will be at least 18 years of age or older.</li><li>Will be approved by the RFC to provide respite in the home of the out-of- home caregiver.</li><li>Will not be on probation, parole, or under indictment for a criminal offense and will have not have a history of crimes against children, which will be verified by background checks as described below in F.</li></ol></li><li>A respite provider is subject to the same confidentiality requirements as other foster care providers and will keep verbal or written information shared with them confidential.</li><li>The out-of-home caregiver will provide the respite caregiver with medical and other critical information about the child and specific instructions for the care and supervision of the child on a completed Respite Care Fact Sheet (SAFE form PR 21). If the child is going to be with a respite caregiver for more than one day, the out-of-home caregiver will also provide the respite caregiver with a copy of the Medicaid card.</li></ol><p>F. Process for approving an In-Home Respite provider:</p><ol><li>The individual will complete an In-Home Respite provider packet (available in SAFE) which includes the following:<ol><li>OL Background screening application: The following background screenings are required on an annual basis for all In-Home Respite providers before being allowed unsupervised access to the child in foster care:<ol><li>&nbsp;Utah Criminal History Bureau of Criminal Identification (BCI): A non- fingerprint-based Utah BCI criminal history check.</li><li>Child and Adult Abuse and Neglect History Checks through SAFE (LIS): SAFE background checks for child and adult abuse and neglect must be approved.</li><li>Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Fingerprint-Based Criminal History must be approved.</li><li>Utah Juvenile Criminal History: A name-based check of the respite provider’s juvenile criminal history must be approved for the respite provider.</li></ol></li><li>A DHHS Provider Code of Conduct must be read and signed.</li><li>An Out-of-home Caregiver Confidentiality Form must be read and signed.</li><li>A Safety and Behavioral Intervention Fact Sheet must be read and signed.</li></ol></li><li>The RFC, out-of-home caregiver, or the prospective In-Home Respite provider will provide the respite packet to the licensor assigned to the out-of-home caregiver. Copies of the forms must be kept by the RFC. The OL licensor will provide the BCI form to the background screening unit within OL to complete the background screening.</li><li>Once the licensor indicates that the In-Home Respite provider has an approved background screening application, the following must also be completed for each child in out-of-home care, prior to the individual providing respite care:<ol><li>The RFC will conduct a further check of SAFE to determine if there is any history of child abuse or neglect. If information is found in SAFE, the RFC must staff the circumstances with a supervisor to determine whether the individual may be approved for In-Home Respite care.</li><li>The out-of-home caregiver will fill out the Respite Care Fact Sheet (PR21) and provide it to the In-Home Respite provider. The out-of-home caregiver will inform the In-Home Respite provider where the Medicaid card for each child is located.</li><li>When possible and if appropriate, the respite arrangements and all relevant issues will be discussed in a Child and Family Team Meeting so that all parties are aware of the arrangement.</li></ol></li></ol><p>G. Requesting Planned Respite:</p><ol><li>To facilitate continuity of care and minimize disruption for the child, whenever possible respite care is to be planned in advance using providers known to the child and family.</li><li>Each out-of-home caregiver for DCFS will identify at least two individuals who agree to provide respite when needed. The names should include at least one In-Home Respite provider. The names of the potential respite providers will be provided to the RFC, who will then assist the out-of-home caregiver in the process to obtain approval for any In-Home Respite provider. The RFC will document the names of the respite providers in the SAFE provider module notes for the out-of-home caregiver.</li><li>The out-of-home caregiver may not place a child in respite care without first informing the RFC and the child’s caseworker at least 72 hours in advance and receiving approval.</li><li>If the out-of-home caregiver is unable to find a respite provider, they may contact the RFC for assistance in finding a respite provider. The out-of-home caregiver will request assistance from the RFC at least 72 hours in advance unless an emergency situation exists (as described below in L).</li></ol><p>H. Responsibilities of Respite Providers:</p><ol><li>The respite provider will ensure that the child attends all necessary appointments while in respite care such as school, family-time with parents, court, and medical and mental health appointments.</li><li>The respite provider will inform the primary out-of-home caregiver and the caseworker of any issues or concerns relating to the child. If the child has a medical or other emergency, the respite provider will contact the out-of-home caregiver and the caseworker immediately.</li><li>The respite provider will ensure that they have a copy of and have reviewed the Respite Care Fact Sheet.</li><li>The skills of the respite provider will match the needs of the child that is in their care, including medical, transportation, and behavioral needs.</li></ol><p>I. Responsibilities of DCFS:</p><ol><li>In situations where out-of-home caregivers are unable to identify their own respite provider, the RFC will assist in identifying an appropriate respite option upon receipt of a written or verbal request.</li><li>The RFC will ensure that the respite caregiver is licensed or meets standards and requirements as outlined above.</li><li>It is best practice for the respite caregivers to be introduced to the child prior to placing the child in respite. If respite is to take place outside the child’s current placement, then the child should be given the opportunity to take a tour of the respite home and ask questions prior to the respite experience.</li><li>The RFC will verify that the out-of-home caregiver provides instruction and information to the respite caregiver.</li></ol><p>J. Responsibilities of the Out-Of-Home Caregiver:</p><ol><li>Obtain approval from the RFC and caseworker to utilize respite and/or inform them of the respite plans. The out-of-home caregiver will provide written or verbal notification to the RFC at least 72 hours in advance. Notification not given at least 72 hours in advance may result in respite not being approved.</li><li>Provide the respite provider with the Respite Care Fact Sheet (PR21), including ensuring that the respite provider has emergency contact information for the out-of-home caregiver, caseworker, and any other relevant staff.&nbsp;</li><li>Ensure that the caseworker has the contact information for the respite provider and emergency contact information for the out-of-home caregiver.</li><li>If utilizing an In-Home Respite provider, ensure that they have an approved BCI prior to utilizing them for In-Home Respite.</li><li>Provide a copy of the Medicaid card to the respite provider.</li></ol><p>K. Each DCFS region is responsible to track the use of respite care and expenditures.</p><p>L. Emergency Care:</p><ol><li>At times, it may be necessary for the out-of-home caregiver to utilize emergency care for a child placed in their home in order to enable the out-of-home caregiver to respond to an urgent situation. In these situations, it is preferable for the caregiver to utilize an identified and pre-approved respite or child care provider to care for the children; however, it may not always be possible. Emergency care may only be used in situations where there is a death, hospitalization, or serious illness of the out-of-home caregiver or anyone in the caregiver’s immediate family; or when another child placed in the caregiver’s home has attempted or succeeded in seriously harming themselves or others.</li><li>If one of the approved respite or child care providers is not available, emergency care can be provided by anyone with whom the out-of-home caregiver feels the child would be safe for a short period of time, until the emergency can be mediated and/or the caregiver, caseworker, or RFC has the ability to make another approved arrangement for the care of the child.</li><li>If an out-of-home caregiver has to utilize emergency care, the caregiver will contact the RFC and caseworker to inform them of the situation as soon as possible and not longer than 24 hours after the child is placed in emergency care. Upon receiving information that the child is in emergency care, the RFC is responsible for ensuring that the caseworker is informed. The caseworker and RFC will work together to ensure that the child is placed in an approved respite placement.</li><li>If the emergency occurs after normal business hours and the out-of-home caregiver is not able to contact the RFC or caseworker, the out-of-home caregiver will contact the Child Protective Services (CPS) Intake number and inform them of where the child is placed. Intake will contact the regional designee when these situations arise.</li><li>In emergency situations, it is allowable for the out-of-home caregiver or DCFS to place with an out-of-home caregiver that may be over capacity of their license. The RFC and/or caseworker will then ensure that the child is placed in another allowable and approved respite placement by the end of the next business day.</li></ol><p>M. Child Care and Incidental Care:</p><ol><li>DCFS does not pay for child care or incidental care for children in an out-of-home placement. Out-of-home caregivers are responsible for the cost of child care or incidental care for the children placed in their home.</li><li>In special circumstances and if funding is available, region directors may grant approval to pay for child care and/or incidental care, when a written request is made by the caseworker or the RFC.</li><li>As with respite care, out-of-home caregivers will provide specific instructions to anyone providing incidental care or child care to a child in out-of-home care on how to care for the child's specific needs prior to the child care or incidental care being utilized. Sharing information regarding the child’s needs is particularly critical in cases where the foster child is medically fragile, on medication, or experiencing behavioral or emotional problems that require special care and supervision.</li><li>Incidental care: Out-of-home caregivers are responsible to ensure that children in their care are always under proper supervision. The out-of-home caregiver must use reasonable and prudent judgement to select individuals to provide incidental care for the foster child. Those providing incidental care must be capable of providing the care and supervision appropriate to the individual need of each child in out-of-home care that they are providing incidental care for.<ol><li>It is best practice to ensure that the RFC, the child’s caseworker, and the Child and Family Team are aware of and approve of incidental care arrangements in advance of the care being provided.</li><li>Incidental care provided by a youth under the age of 18 years may be approved on a case-by-case basis and should be discussed and approved at minimum by the RFC and caseworker and, when possible, the Child and Family Team.</li><li>It is best practice for the caseworker or RFC to assess whether an individual approved to provide incidental care has the ability and skills to care for the needs of the child.</li></ol></li><li>Child Care:<ol><li>Child care providers who are licensed through the DHHS Child Care Licensing Program are approved to provide ongoing child care to children in out-of-home care. The out-of-home caregiver, caseworker, or RFC should verify that the license is current by asking to review a copy of the child care provider’s license.</li><li>Child care providers who are not licensed through the Department of Health and who will be providing child care on a continual, regular basis (such as when the foster parent is working) OR care for a child in out-of-home care in excess of five hours a week, must have an approved background check. When child care is being provided in a location other than the licensed out-of-home caregiver’s home, a home safety walkthrough is required to ensure they can safely care for the child. The home safety walkthrough will be completed by the caseworker or RFC using the KBS16 Limited Home Inspection form.</li><li>The following requirements will be completed for a potential child care provider for a licensed out-of-home caregiver (not licensed through the DHHS) by the OL on an annual basis, before the child care provider is allowed unsupervised access to the child in out-of-home care:<ol><li>Utah Criminal History BCI: A non-fingerprint-based Utah BCI criminal history check.</li><li>&nbsp;Child and Adult Abuse and Neglect History Checks through SAFE: SAFE background checks for child and adult abuse and neglect must be approved.</li><li>FBI Fingerprint-Based Criminal History: An FBI fingerprint-based criminal history check must also be approved.</li><li>Utah Juvenile Criminal History: A name-based check of the respite provider’s juvenile criminal history must be approved for the respite provider.</li></ol></li><li>Copies of the forms must be kept by the RFC. The OL licensor will provide the BCI form to the background screening unit within the OL to complete the background screening. The RFC will document in the provider notes when a child care provider has been approved.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Page 162</p>\n  </div>"

Any pre-service training hours completed within the previous 24 months of an individual seeking licensure may be accepted as long as there is no documentation or evidence that there were concerns regarding the caregiver. DCFS reserves the right to require any caregiver to re-take part or all of pre-service classes if deemed necessary. Special situations:<ol><li>1)If a prospective caregiver applying for either a Licensed Foster Care (LFC) or Licensed Specific Child (LSC) license has completed comparable training (with another state or agency), a request for an exception to complete the training will be submitted in writing by the Resource Family Consultant (RFC) to the foster care program administrator or other designated staff at the State Office. The foster care program administrator or other designated staff will assess the training completed by the prospective caregiver and the specific case information (if applicable), and will provide a decision in writing to the RFC as to whether or not the training can be accepted within 30 working days of receiving the request.</li><li>2) If a caregiver applying for an LSC license is deemed unable to complete the DCFS approved pre-service training within the required timeframe of the probationary license, the RFC and the potential foster parent will work with the current DCFS Contractor for Training, Recruitment, and Retention Services of Foster Parents on alternative ways to complete the pre-service training. A request for an exception will be submitted in writing by the RFC (or KFC) to the foster care program administrator or other designated staff at the DCFS State Office. The request for training exception must include the reason that the caregiver is unable to complete the training in the required timeframe; what attempts were made, if any, to complete the training; and what the alternative plan (including timeframes) is for the caregiver to complete the pre-service training. The foster care program administrator or other designated staff will assess the information and will provide a decision in writing to the RFC as to whether or not the alternative plan is accepted within 30 working days of receiving the request.</li></ol></li><li>Pre-service classes include information about:<ol><li>1) Orientation and Team Building; DCFS Major objectives and Procedure, Licensing Rules, and Medical Requirements for Children in Out-of-Home Care; Abuse and Neglect, Child Sexual Abuse; Impacts of Abuse on the Child Development; Attachment, Separation, Grief, and Loss; Discipline &amp; Effects of Caregiving on the Family; Cultural Issues, Primary Families; and Adoption Issues;</li><li>2)Rights and responsibilities as caregivers and the partnership role with DCFS in providing services to the child and family;</li><li>3)Responding to the individual needs of children placed in their<br>home, including the needs of abused and neglected children and the importance of the cultural and ethnic contexts for service;</li><li>4)Sensitive and responsive practices to use with the biological<br>parents, which address issues such as involving them in decisions about their children’s lives, encouraging family-time, and ways to maintain the parent-child relationship (unless contraindicated by the service plan);</li><li>5)The use of out-of-home care as a temporary intervention, except when planned alternative living arrangements have been clearly determined to be the appropriate plan for therapeutic reasons, or when adoption or guardianship by the kin or out-of-home caregivers has become the plan;</li><li>6) Circumstances that terminate the caregiving relationship and<br>informs them regarding appeal Practice Guidelines, which gives them notice and opportunity to be heard in any review or hearing regarding the child;</li><li>7)Accessing, via the DCFS eligibility process and staff, government payments on behalf of the child, including Medicaid cards, social security, and other public assistance; and</li><li>8) The organization’s major objectives on compensation for damages done by children placed in their care.</li><li>9) Other training topics deemed appropriate by DCFS.</li></ol></li><li><p>For ongoing licensure, completion of 16 hours of in-service training hours annually prior to re-licensure is required. If there are two caregivers in the household, the 16 hours is the total number of in-service training hours required for both caregivers combined, with neither caregiver having less than four hours. A minimum of four hours of in-service training per caregiver must be completed in a face-to-face or classroom setting. Three hours may be completed through other multimedia sources, as outlined below (pre-recorded online courses, parenting instruction videos, or other publications). The remainder of the hours may be completed in person or via live facilitated interactive online training.

If a foster parent repeats any amount of pre-service training, the full amount will count towards the in- service training requirement. Training completed through the Contractor will be entered into the SAFE database by the Contractor. Foster parents should also maintain copies of verification (attendance rolls, certificates, etc.) that they have attended training through the Contractor.</li><li>2) Training hours may also be completed through foster parent<br>attendance and participation in any classes or trainings offered to out-of-home caregivers by DCFS.</li><li>3) Other in-service training hours may be completed by the out of- home caregiver through the following process:<ol><li>Community-based trainings and conferences: The DCFS State Office will maintain a list of pre-approved community-based trainings or conferences for in-service training credit. Any other trainings or conferences not on the pre-approved list must be pre-approved by the RFC or other designated DCFS staff in order for the caregiver to receive in-service training hours. Community-based training and conferences must be provided by well renowned institutions or collaborations and/or should be based on evidence-based practices that will increase the knowledge and skills of the caregivers. The training/conference may cover general topics that can be related to parenting children in foster care, or it may be specific to the needs of a particular child being cared for by the caregiver. The caregiver must obtain verification of attendance in order to receive credit for in-service training hours. The caregiver will keep a copy of the verification of attendance and will provide a copy to the RFC or other designated staff.</li><li>The RFC will forward the verification of training to the designated person with the DCFS Contractor for Training, Recruitment, and Retention Services of Foster Parents for entry into the SAFE database. The designated person will enter completed trainings attended by out-of-home caregivers into the SAFE database within 10 business days of receiving the training documentation.</li><li>Training through other multimedia sources, such as on-line courses, parenting instructional videos, or other publications (such as books): Out-of-home caregivers may complete a portion of their in-service training hours through pre-approved online courses (including those provided through the DCFS Contractor for Training, Recruitment, and Retention Services of Foster Parents) parenting instructional videos, or other publications. The training may be general or it may be specific to the needs of a particular child, and should be based on evidence-based practices. The DCFS State Office will maintain a list of pre-approved sources for in-service training credit through these methods. The list of pre-approved resources will also outline how many hours of training credit may be received from each source.</li><li>In order for out-of-home caregivers to receive in-service training credit from completion of an online course, parenting instructional video, or other publications, the caregiver must provide a typed summary of the training to the RFC or other designated DCFS staff. A standardized form can be obtained from the RFC for the summary. The summary will include knowledge and skills that the caregiver gained from the training and how the caregiver will apply the knowledge and skills when parenting children in care. If an online course has a post-test component that tests the knowledge of the caregiver following course completion, the caregiver may provide verification of passing the post-test for training credit rather than the summary. The RFC or designated staff will review the summary or documentation provided by the caregiver and determine whether the information meets the requirements for in-service training. If it meets the requirements for in-service training, the information will be forwarded to the designated staff member at the current DCFS Contractor for Training, Recruitment, and Retention Services of Foster Parents for entry into SAFE.</li><li>The designated staff member at the DCFS Contractor for Training, Recruitment, and Retention Services of Foster Parents will enter completed trainings into the SAFE database within 10 business days of receiving the training documentation.</li><li>Any person wanting to add a source to the pre-approved list of in-service training sources will forward a request to the DCFS foster care program administrator or other<br>designated staff at the DCFS State Office. The request will provide any relevant information regarding the source, including a summary of the information covered along with any indication that it is evidence-based practice (if known).</li></ol></li><li>4) Tracking annual in-service training hours:<ol><li>One hundred and twenty days prior to foster care licensure<br>renewal for an out-of-home caregiver, the RFC assigned to the caregiver or other designated DCFS staff will review the completed in-service training hours in SAFE and determine whether the caregiver has the required amount of in-service training hours.</li><li>If the caregiver has already received credit for the required<br>number of training hours, no further action is required.</li><li>If the caregiver has a deficiency in the number of in-service training hours needed for re-licensure, the RFC or staff will contact the caregiver to determine if they will be renewing their foster care licensure. If the caregiver will be renewing, the RFC or staff will do the following:<ol><li>i)Provide written notification to the caregiver regarding the number of hours still needed prior to re-licensure, including what will happen if they do not obtain the required number of training hours.</li><li>ii)Coordinate with the caregiver to determine if there are hours of in-service training that they have not yet been credited and assist them in the process of ensuring those hours are entered into SAFE.</li><li>iii)Assist the caregiver in identifying potential training sources to help them obtain the required number of training hours.</li><li>iv)Make monthly contact with the caregiver to determine their progress on completing in-service training. The RFC or designated staff will document monthly contacts in the provider notes in SAFE.</li><li>v) If the caregiver is unable to obtain the required number of hours needed for in-service training and still desires to maintain licensure, the RFC or staff will help them identify what steps they must take in order to obtain re-licensure.</li></ol></li><li>If the caregiver informs the RFC or designated staff that they will not be pursuing re-licensure, this information will be documented in the provider notes in SAFE.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>An affirmation of compliance with Administrative Rule <a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/rpryuja26jme49d156gcyue1ft2v1qcr\">R512-302</a>.</li><li>DCFS may identify or require a specific training for all foster parents. DCFS may also require a specific training for an individual foster parent to help them provide for the needs of a particular child.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>C. All other licensing requirements for the home must be met and maintained. Refer to the OL Rules, Child Foster Care <a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/p5799jc5ikir8isxjilp27j0fsqvvv5w\">R501-12</a>. Requirements for licensure may include but are not limited to:<ol><li>A BCI criminal records check and a check of the state’s child abuse registry for all adults, 18 years or older, residing in the home.</li><li>A Resource Family Assessment and/or a home study will be completed by the OL or other approved contractor using the standardized family assessment format. This includes references, a medical reference letter completed by a licensed health care professional, and a mental health evaluation if needed.</li></ol></li><li>D. Reimbursement for services commensurate with the cost of maintaining the child will be provided to the out-of-home caregiver at the rate established by the Utah State Legislature, and also based on the needs of the child.</li><li>E. Foster Care Agreement:<ol><li>The Foster Care Agreement (Form 638A) must be signed annually by each licensed out-of-home caregiver. If there are two licensed out-of-home caregivers in a home, they may sign on the same form. For kinship caregivers, the Foster Care Agreement will be signed at the time of licensure and will replace the Kinship Caregiver Preliminary Placement Agreement (KBS04).</li><li>The RFC assigned to the foster parent, or other assigned DCFS staff will review the Foster Care Agreement and address any concerns with the out-of-home caregiver. The RFC will obtain a signed Foster Care Agreement from the licensed out-of-home caregiver annually.<ol><li>Once signed, the Foster Care Agreement is effective until the end of the licensure period or one year from the time of signing the agreement, whichever is sooner.</li><li>For newly licensed foster parents, the Foster Care Agreement should be obtained within 30 days of receiving the home study, unless the DCFS region has made the determination that the home will not be used for placements.</li><li>For foster parents who have been licensed more than a year, a signed copy of the Foster Care Agreement should be obtained within the 30 days prior to expiration of the former Foster Care Agreement. This can be done in person, through the mail, or through electronic methods (such as a scanned version of the signed agreement sent through email).</li><li>Copies of the signed Foster Care Agreement will be kept in the Out-of- Home Caregiver’s file.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>F. Placement Agreement:<ol><li>The Placement Agreement (Form 638B) must be signed each time a child is placed in the home of an out-of-home caregiver. If there are two licensed out-of- home caregivers in a home, they may sign on the same form.</li><li>The caseworker or supervisor assigned to the child will review the Foster Care Agreement and address any concerns with the out-of-home caregiver, and obtain a signed copy from the caregiver. The RFC assigned to oversee the home may assist in obtaining the signed Placement Agreement, if necessary.</li><li>A signed copy of the Placement Agreement should be obtained within 30 days of placing the child in the home. This can be done in person, through the mail, or through electronic methods (such as a scanned version of the signed agreement sent through email).</li><li>Once signed, the Placement Agreement is effective for the duration of the child’s placement of the child with the out-of-home caregiver, or until DCFS custody of the child ends.</li></ol></li><li>G. Claims for Property Damage: DCFS will, when circumstances warrant, help foster parents and kinship placements deal with property damaged by a foster child placed in the home. This aid covers only physical loss or damage that is caused by the direct action of any foster child in the care of the foster care provider or kinship placement.<ol><li>Claims must be filed within 90 days of the initial incident date. Exceptions to the 90-day limit may be granted on a case-by-case basis.</li><li>With proper approval, DCFS may provide financial help up to but not to exceed $1,500 per claim. For the first claim in a fiscal year (July 1 through June 30), a $150 deductible will first be applied. For any additional claims filed within the same fiscal year, the deductible will be reduced to $50. The calculation of the financial aid will take into account the age, condition, and depreciation of the property at the time of the incident. Financial aid will not necessarily be based on replacement value. The dollar value of replacement items or repairs must be supported with independent documentation.</li><li>It is the intention of this program to help with material claims. Damaged items whose value is below $150 will not be covered.</li><li>In order to start the claim process, the foster care provider will work with the region Resource Family Consultant (RFC) and the caseworker utilizing the <a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/p4ipfab3s95ov6awekvwbq8vattc0gvp\">305- Damage Letter and Claim Form</a>, and email it to the DCFS state office at <a href=\"mailto:fosterparentclaim@utah.gov\">fosterparentclaim@utah.gov</a>.</li></ol></li></ul><p>Page 152</p>\n  </div>"

These children have a greater likelihood of emancipating from the system and not achieving legal permanency or permanent connections.</p><p>Preferred permanency outcomes for children are Reunification, Adoption, Guardianship Relative, or Guardianship Non-Relative. Emancipation is the least preferred outcome but in the event that it becomes inevitable, youth aging out of care should have an array of informal permanent connections, healthy relationships, and access to formal resources.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Practice Guidelines<br>A. Selecting cases for PRT: Cases involving children who are likely to remain in out-of-home care until the age of majority should be considered for a PRT. Characteristics of cases that could be prioritized for PRTs might include cases open of longer duration, cases with primary and concurrent goals of Independent Permanency, and cases with older youth.</p><p>B. Training: All participants in a PRT must complete both Permanency Values training and<br>Permanency Skills training.</p><p>C. PRT documents to be used in the PRT process:</p><ol><li>Case Summary Sheet.</li><li>Oral case presentation.</li><li>Action Plan, which concludes at 90 days.</li><li>Picture of youth.</li><li>Genogram (optional).</li><li>Timeline (optional).</li></ol><p>D. PRT participants and definition of roles: Limiting participation is intended to engender an environment of openness without reprisal (applicable exceptions are allowed under the role of Other).</p><ol><li>Caseworker: The caseworker assigned to the case. The caseworker is responsible to be prepared with the oral case presentation and answer questions from the group.</li><li>Supervisor: The supervisor of the caseworker attends the PRT and may also be asked to provide case history and information.</li><li>Master practitioner: The master practitioner is an expert in permanency work and/or an expert in navigating unique challenges that may exist in specific types of cases. There can be more than one master practitioner involved in a PRT.</li><li>Neutral facilitator: A person outside of the administrative chain of command for the case selected for a PRT. The facilitator will not lead the discussion in a particular direction but will take an active role in establishing an environment that stimulates and promotes the free exchange of ideas. The facilitator is responsible to make sure that all parties are focused on looking for solutions rather than getting caught up in the past. The facilitator is also responsible for keeping the PRT team on schedule, following the structure of the PRT process, and ensuring that an Action Plan is developed. The facilitator may enlist another member of the PRT team to be a time keeper.</li><li>External permanency consultant: A person who is outside of the administrative chain of command for the case selected. It is preferred that the consultant be outside of the region where the case management is conducted. The consultant is primarily responsible to provide suggestions during brainstorming and action planning.</li><li>Scribe: The scribe manages all the record keeping for the PRT process, which includes completing the PRT Action Plan documents.</li><li>Others: On rare occasions, the situation may require a specialist from outside of the agency to provide specific knowledge, skills, and expertise, which will assist the work of permanency. In these situations, the participant should have completed the Values training. Others may also be DCFS staff not otherwise designated in any of the other PRT roles.</li></ol><p>E. PRT process:</p><ol><li>Welcome, Overview of PRT, and Working Agreement (5 Minutes):<br>Establishing rules for the PRT. Some rules that should be considered include no electronics and maintain permanency focus.</li><li>Case Presentation (20 Minutes): Caseworker presents the case using the Oral Case Presentation outline. The caseworker’s presentation is uninterrupted. At the conclusion, the supervisor may also be given an opportunity to add information to the presentation. No questions from the group are allowed in this portion of the PRT.</li><li>Clarify and Explore (15 Minutes): This is the opportunity for the PRT team members to ask questions that will add clarity to the presentation. No brainstorming or solution finding is allowed in this portion of the PRT.</li><li>Brainstorm Session (25 Minutes): Free-flowing generation of ideas.</li><li>Action Planning (35 Minutes): Group brainstorm into key strategic themes, develop measureable action steps, identify barriers and solutions for barriers, assign responsible parties, and establish deadlines. Responsibility of Action Steps should be shared by all participants of the PRT team.&nbsp;</li><li>Debrief (5 Minutes): Check-in with the caseworker and supervisor regarding the implementation of the Action Plan, lessons learned, etc.</li></ol><p>F. Accessing Casey Grant dollars for barrier busting: Casey Family Programs has provided money to assist caseworkers in overcoming barriers to achieving permanency.</p><ol><li>All approved requests must comply with rules for procurement.</li><li>Requests for money for services and resources should be accompanied by a request form (TBD).</li><li>All requests must include a rationale for how this will promote legal permanency or permanent connections for the youth.</li><li>All requests exceeding $500 (excluding travel, lodging, or per diem) must be screened by the Program and Practice Improvement Team (PPIT).</li></ol><p>Page 145</p>\n  </div>"

The CLSA tool is intended to assist in the planning of services for youth as they transition from childhood to adulthood.</p><p>B. Results from the CLSA tool will be used to evaluate the youth’s strengths, needs, and current functioning in areas of life skills. After the CLSA is completed by a youth, the areas identified on the CLSA where the youth may need instruction and personal growth will be used to focus and guide the Child and Family Team in the case planning process with the youth. The case planning decisions developed by the team will then be included in the Child and Family Plan.</p><p>C. The caseworker will ensure that the following is accomplished:</p><ol><li>The CLSA is completed by the youth and the caregiver, at a minimum. The CLSA may also be completed by additional individuals who are familiar with the youth.</li><li>Meet with the youth to review the youth and caregiver’s assessments, choose the areas to work on, identify individualized goals, and outline strategies for the growth and improvement of the youth.</li><li>Convene the Child and Family Team to review the CLSA results, update the Child and Family Assessment, and develop or update the TAL section of the youth’s Child and Family Plan.</li></ol><p>D. The caseworker will assist the youth and the caregiver(s) in completing the CLSA:</p><ol><li>When a youth 14 years of age and older enters out-of-home care, the CLSA will be completed by the youth and the caregiver within 45 days, in conjunction with the development of the Child and Family Plan.</li><li>When a youth turns 14 years old in foster care, the first CLSA must be completed when the next Child and Family Plan is due. If the next plan is due in less than 90 days after the youth’s 14th birthdate, the CLSA will not be required until the following plan.</li><li>An annual CLSA is due within a year of the previous one. The caseworker will be prompted 90 days prior to the due date to give the youth and caregiver ample time to complete the assessment.</li><li>&nbsp;The caregiver’s assessment and youth’s assessment must be completed and entered on the CLSA website within 30 days of each other. The CLSA can be completed electronically via the Internet at: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221008124419/https://www.casey.org/casey-life-skills/\">http://www.caseylifeskills.org.</a></li><li>The caseworker has the following options for assisting the youth in taking the CLSA:<ol><li>The youth can take the assessment on the caseworker’s computer.</li><li>The caseworker can send a link to the youth via the youth’s email address inviting them to take the assessment.</li><li>The caseworker can give the youth a printed assessment. The caseworker will need to enter the answers of the assessment into the website.</li><li>The youth can create his or her own profile on the website. This option will only work if the youth has already taken an assessment using option a or b.</li></ol></li><li>The caseworker has the following options to assist the caregiver in taking the assessment:<ol><li>The caregiver can take the assessment on the caseworker’s computer.</li><li>The caseworker can send a link to the caregiver via email inviting them to take to the assessment.</li><li>The caseworker can give the caregiver a printed assessment. The caseworker will need to enter the answers of the assessment into the website.</li></ol></li><li>The caseworker will provide the youth and the caregiver with a copy of both the youth and caregiver’s reports from the CLSA.</li><li>The original CLSA assessment will be placed in the assessment section of each youth’s case file.</li></ol><p>E. Each caseworker will convene the Child and Family Team to review the youth and caregiver(s) assessments, identify areas of strengths and opportunities for improvement, share feedback on the youth’s chosen areas on which to work, and look for ways to support the individualized goals of the youth. The team will then outline strategies to implement the plan.</p><p>F. The goals, services, and needs identified by the youth, caregiver, and Child and Family Team will be used to develop and update the TAL portion of the youth’s Child and Family Plan. The TAL portion of the plan requires each youth to have at least one area of focus determined by the CLSA and Child and Family Team to enhance their life skills. The regional TAL coordinator or a TAL supervisor will attend the Child and Family Team Meeting when possible. If the regional TAL coordinator or a TAL supervisor is not able to attend the Child Family Team Meeting, they should attempt to be available for consultation with members of the Child and Family Team prior to or following the meeting.</p><p>Page 130</p>\n  </div>"

Learner Permit</p><ol><li>Caseworkers are <em><strong>not</strong></em> authorized to sign for a learner permit.</li><li>To obtain a learner permit, a parent, foster parent, or responsible adult’s signature is required for a youth to obtain a driver license. A parent, foster parent, or responsible adult who is willing to assume the liability of a minor driver and provide for motor vehicle insurance for the youth may sign the minor’s application for a driver license. Foster parents need to provide Form Letter TR01: Placement Verification and Medical Authorization Letter when signing for the driver license.</li><li>A learner permit allows the youth to drive with a licensed adult and receive the 40 hours of practice driving required for a license. When a parent or responsible adult signs the application for the learner permit, they are assuming joint liability with the youth for damages resulting from the youth driving a motor vehicle. Those under 18 years of age will be limited to driving with a licensed parent, legal guardian, driving instructor, or the adult who signed the application for the learner permit sitting in the passenger seat.</li><li>When applying for the learner permit, the youth will need to have their Social Security card plus two acceptable types of proof of residency. A $15.00 fee is required to obtain the learner permit from the Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV), and the learner permit is only valid for one year.</li><li>Utah requires an applicant 17 years of age or younger to have the learner permit for six months before applying for a driver license. The six-month learner permit holding requirement does not apply to an applicant who is age 18 years or older at the time of application for the learner permit.</li></ol><p>C.

Some episodes of transportation may require more caution than other episodes. Transportation has been divided into three categories to assist caseworkers in determining when it might be appropriate to utilize the support of another caseworker or a caged Juvenile Justice Services (JJS) state vehicle for the transport of a youth. The Child and Family Team will assist with making these decisions.</p><p>Practice Guidelines<br>A. STANDARD TRANSPORTATION – A situation in which a caseworker transports a youth to family-time, medical appointments, or other routine occurrences.</p><p>There will be many situations in which a caseworker feels comfortable and appropriate in transporting a youth. When doing so, a caseworker will assure the following:</p><ol><li>That the vehicle is insured and safe to drive (use a state vehicle and avoid the use of personal vehicles if possible).&nbsp;</li><li>That the youth is properly restrained in a safety device appropriate for the age of the youth. In addition, appropriate child locks will be utilized.</li><li>That the youth is not allowed to sit behind the caseworker who is driving the vehicle.</li><li>That a supervisor or colleague knows where you are going and when you will return as a safety precaution.</li><li>That you take another caseworker with you if you feel it is appropriate or necessary for any reason.</li></ol><p>B. TRANSPORTATION TO A PROGRAM – A situation in which a youth is being transported to a facility or program.</p><p>The caseworker should first contact the program to request the program transport the youth if this service/resource is available.&nbsp;</p><p>If a caseworker must transport the youth, it is best practice for two caseworkers/employees to transport the youth when the youth is going to a facility; however, the caseworker should use their discretion. Assuming the youth does not display behaviors associated with a high risk transportation need, the caseworker will consider utilizing another person to complete the transport.</p><ol><li>The caseworker will review the case thoroughly prior to the transport and be aware of any potential triggers that may cause the youth to display volatile or aggressive behavior toward him or herself or others.</li><li>The caseworker will assure that the vehicle is insured and safe to drive (use a state vehicle and avoid the use of personal vehicles if possible).</li><li>Two caseworkers will transport the child; one caseworker will drive and one caseworker will sit in the backseat with the youth. The youth will not be allowed to sit behind the caseworker who is driving the vehicle.</li><li>The youth will be properly restrained in a safety device appropriate for the age of the youth. In addition, appropriate child locks will be utilized.</li><li>Neither the youth nor the caseworkers will use a cell phone to make phone calls or texts while driving unless an emergency situation arises.</li></ol><p>C. HIGH RISK TRANSPORTATION – A situation in which a caseworker or youth may be at risk of displaying behaviors associated with a high risk transportation need.</p><p>A situation for high risk transportation may be identified if the youth exhibits any of the following behaviors:</p><ol><li><p>Current assaultive behavior, assaultive history, serious aggression toward self or others, past history of jumping from a vehicle in motion, a suicide attempt, serious and current self-mutilization, homicidal thoughts or behavior, current psychosis, serious inability to regulate emotions, serious anti-social behavior, current verbal or physical threats of harm to self or caseworker, or other similar and serious behaviors.</p><p>Hint: If the youth rates a 3 on the CANS on any of the following items, the youth most likely meets the criteria to utilize a caged JJS state vehicle:</p><ol><li>Suicide risk;</li><li>Self-mutilization;</li><li>Other self-harm;</li><li>Danger to others;</li><li>Judgment decision-making (make decisions that put them in dangerous situations);</li><li>Psychosis;</li><li>Oppositional (threat of physical harm to others);</li><li>Conduct (serious crime, aggression, anti-social child, or community at risk);</li><li>Anger control.</li></ol></li></ol><p>The process for requesting assistance with a high risk transportation is as follows:</p><ol><li>Call the facility that you are taking the youth to and ask if they can transport the youth for you. If they are unable to do so, move to step 2.</li><li>Staff the case with the region clinical consultant and review all possible transportation options. The clinical consultant will determine if a caged JJS state vehicle is the only safe option. If a caged JJS vehicle is necessary, then complete the following steps to request one:<ol><li>The clinical consultant will send an email to Mike Butkovich, Program Director, Office of Correctional Programs, Utah Division of Juvenile Justice Service at <a href=\"mailto:mbutkovi@utah.gov\">mbutkovi@utah.gov</a> and include the caseworker in the email. The email should include the pick-up and drop-off time needed for the vehicle and the current location of the child.</li><li>The JJS Program Director will respond to both the clinical consultant and caseworker with the availability and location of the vehicle.</li><li>The caseworker will pick up and drop off the vehicle at the assigned locations. If a vehicle is no longer needed, the caseworker will notify the JJS Program Director immediately.</li></ol></li></ol><p>D. If a JJS caged vehicle is not available, contact the region director for potential use of further professional transport services.</p><p>Page 123</p>\n  </div>"

Preserving connections can help maintain activities children and youth were participating in prior to entering custody with those familial relationships (i.e., going to movies with grandmother, getting ice cream, sleepovers with cousins, etc.). Preserving connections may also be used for short-term provisions, which could include incidental care, child care, respite care, emergency care, and other options for temporary relief. This includes all persons familiar with the child and who have a relationship (i.e., grandparents, aunts/uncles, cousins, adult siblings, coaches, teachers, leaders, etc.) prior to the child entering care. Infants are considered to have a relationship similar to siblings or relationships that would have naturally occurred had the child remained in parental care. Natural supports (not including family) need to be relationships the child had prior to coming into care. [See also: Section 300.7.]</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Practice Guidelines:<br>A. Identifying preserving connections:</p><ol><li>When identifying individuals who are considered as preserving connections, the DCFS shall ask:<br>a. The parent or caregiver: Who has been their support in caring for their child? Who helped the parent or caregiver with their child before coming into custody? Have the parents/caregivers had the child live temporarily with anyone? If the child is an infant and/or this is the first child, consider asking who the parents have reached out to for support with the child.<br>b. The child: Who would they seek out for support when their parent or caregiver is not available? Who would they stay with when their parents are unavailable? Which family members and family friends do they feel comfortable with and want to maintain a connection with?<br>c. Extended family on both sides of the family: Who has had a relationship with the child? Are there any other important connections to the child? Create a genogram, ecomap, etc.<br>d. The Child and Family Team: Who has the child spent a lot of time with and would benefit from maintaining a connection with?</li><li>Other considerations that can be used to identify individuals who can be considered preserving connections:<br>a. Extra-curricular activities (sports, dance, scouts, etc.).<br>b. Religious affiliations.<br>c. Tribal affiliations (ICWA).<br>d. School (teacher, coach, counselors, etc.).<br>e. Former placements (foster homes, proctor homes, etc.).<br>f. Neighbors.<br>g. Other community connections.</li></ol><p>B. Assessing preserving connections’ ability to help: Discuss the need for connection and possible assistance to the placement or child during a Child and Family Team Meeting.</p><ol><li>Consider using items from the Permanency Pact to explore ways to offer support.</li><li>Discuss expectations, availability, and schedules.</li></ol><p>C. Approving proposed preserving connections through the teaming process:</p><ol><li>Caseworkers will have the proposed preserving connections complete a background screening form.<br>a. Caseworkers will send a background screening form to the BCI support team to be screened.<br>b. Any history that poses a direct potential safety concern to the child will be discussed privately with the proposed preserving connections, and permission to share this information with the full Child and Family Team<br>or the legal partners (AAG and GAL) for further review will be requested. If the person does not want the information shared, they will not be considered for preserving connections.&nbsp;</li><li>Concerns identified may be addressed by additional assessments and/or home visits.</li><li>Concerns that are discussed at the Child and Family Team Meeting and decisions made by the team must be documented in activity logs.</li><li>The Child and Family Team approves the list of people included as preserving connections.</li><li>Ongoing assessment of preserving connections will occur at Child and Family Team Meetings, and the team will make adjustments as needed.</li></ol><p>D. Documenting preserving connections and sharing with out-of-home caregivers/providers:</p><ol><li>Preserving connections are documented in SAFE with the preserving connections form. The preserving connections form will be updated as needed and reviewed each time the Child and Family Plan is updated.</li><li>Caseworkers will share the preserving connections form with each out-of-home caregiver/placement as a resource.</li><li>Caseworkers will review the preserving connections form with each caregiver/provider and explain the importance of maintaining relationships and prioritizing use of preserving connections as outlined.</li></ol><p>Page 70<br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>"

Division responsibilities.</p><p>Practice Guidelines<br>A. Out-of-home caseworker visits help assure safety, permanency, and well-being. Using face-to-face visits with children, out-of-home caregivers, and parents provides out-of- home caseworkers an opportunity to deepen the helping relationship. Findings from the DCFS Review (CFSR) found that there is a significant positive relationship between out-of-home caseworker visits with children and a number of other indicators for safety, permanency, and well-being. These indicators include:</p><ol><li>Providing services to protect children in the home.</li><li>Preventing removal.</li><li>Managing the risk of harm to children.</li><li>Establishing permanency goals.</li><li>Achieving reunification, guardianship, and permanent placement with relatives.</li><li>Achieving the goal of other planned living arrangements.</li><li>Placement with siblings.</li><li>Preserving children’s connections while in out-of-home care.</li><li>Maintaining the child’s relationship with parents.</li><li>Assessing needs and providing services to children and families.</li><li>Involving children and parents in case planning.</li><li>Visiting with parents.</li><li>Meeting the educational needs of the child.</li><li>Meeting the physical health needs of the child.</li><li>Meeting the mental health needs of the child.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>B. Caseworker contact with the child: The caseworker will visit with the child. Visit is defined as a face-to-face meeting between the child and the caseworker and must include the following elements:</p><ol><li>Frequency - visits must occur as frequently as the conditions of the case require and no less frequently than at least monthly.</li><li>Location - the environment of the location of the visits must be conducive to open and honest conversation. At least one monthly caseworker contact with the child must take place in the out-of-home placement. The interview between the caseworker and the child must be conducted away from the parent or substitute caregiver unless the child refuses or exhibits anxiety. Siblings may be interviewed together or separately, depending on the comfort level of the children or if there are safety considerations.</li><li>Duration - the length of the visit must be of sufficient duration to address key issues.</li><li>Quality discussion - the content of the interview should focus on key issues pertinent to safety (including threats of harm, child vulnerabilities, and protective capacities of the caregiver), permanency, and well-being, as well as promotes the achievement of case goals. When the child is nonverbal or unable to communicate, the caseworker will document that the child is nonverbal and instead report observations regarding the child’s appearance pertaining to physical well-being.</li><li>In working with an older youth, empower the youth by helping them to address their desires or needs. This enables the youth to have an opportunity to practice skills necessary for adulthood. It is also important to include youth as active members of the team. Youth should be included in all decisions that affect their lives. These will help to make it more likely that the youth’s needs will be met and that they will be able to establish positive relationships.</li><li>As needed, the out-of-home caseworker and other members of the Child and Family Team develop the specifics of the Family-Time Plan as well as to decide who will make additional visits and contacts with the child. Document this in the Child and Family Plan.</li><li>If the child is placed outside the state, the out-of-home caseworker will have at least one telephone conversation per month with the child (if the child is verbal) and with the child’s out-of-home caregiver. In addition, the out-of-home caseworker will request through the Interstate Compact Placement Agreement that a courtesy caseworker have a monthly face-to-face visit with the child and provide a written report of the visit to the Utah out-of-home caseworker each quarter.</li></ol><p>C. &nbsp;Caseworker contact with the out-of-home caregiver: The caseworker will visit with the out-of-home caregiver on a monthly basis. Visiting with the out-of-home caregivers will help to establish and maintain a working relationship.</p><ol><li>At a minimum, the caseworker will conduct one monthly face-to-face contact with the substitute caregiver with whom the child is living. The caseworker will assess with the substitute caregiver the safety (including threats of harm, child vulnerabilities, and protective capacities of the caregiver), permanency, and well-being needs of the child and the substitute caregiver’s needs as it pertains to the child’s needs.</li><li>Reviewing on a quarterly basis with the out-of-home caregiver the child’s Home-to-Home Book. (See <a href=\"/foster/ut-utah-department-health-and-human-services-division-children-and-family-services-71\">Section 303.3 </a>Maintaining The Home-To-Home Book.)</li></ol><p>D. Monthly caseworker contact with the child’s parents: The caseworker will have regular contact with each parent to assess safety, permanency, and well-being of the children and to promote achievement of case goals.</p><ol><li>For the purpose of monthly caseworker contact with parent, parent is defined as:<br><br>a. The legally recognized birth mother regardless of physical custody or current level of involvement in the child’s life.<br>b. The legally recognized father regardless of physical custody or current level of involvement in the child’s life.<br>c. The legally recognized adoptive mother and/or father.<br>d. The legally recognized guardian.<br>e. The caregiver with whom the child was living with at the time DCFS became involved AND with whom the child may be reunited. This may include relative caregivers and non-relative caregivers such as stepparents.<br>f. The substitute caregiver(s) that has been identified as the person(s) who will be imminently providing enduring permanency for the child.</li><li>Contact is defined as a face-to-face meeting between the parent and the caseworker and must include the following elements:<br>a. Frequency - visits must occur at least monthly.<br>b. Location - the environment of the location of the visits must be conducive to open and honest conversation.<br>c. Duration - the length of the visit must be of sufficient duration to address key issues.<br>d. Quality discussion - the content of the interview should focus on issues pertinent to case planning, service delivery, and goal achievement.</li><li>Exceptions for caseworker contact with parent include:<br>a. The parent is deceased.<br>b. Parental rights are terminated.<br>c. Parent’s active or passive refusal to participate.<br><br>(1) Active Refusal: Parent expresses verbally or in writing that they are not interested in having monthly contact with the caseworker. In this case, the caseworker must periodically verify with the parent that they still decline contact. Periodic means that the caseworker attempts to make some type of contact whether it be face-to-face, phone, or correspondence with the parent at a minimum of a quarterly basis if reunification is the goal. If reunification has been terminated but parental rights are still in place, periodic contact means every six months.<br>(2) Passive Refusal: Parent indicates a passive refusal to have monthly contact with the worker through their actions or inactions, such as failing to keep appointments or returning messages. In this case, the caseworker must make at least two attempts a month to contact the parent face-to-face, by phone or correspondance, while<br>reunification services are provided to that parent. When reunification is terminated but parental rights are still in place, periodic attempts to contact the parent may be reduced to every six months.<br>(3) The caseworker will document the dates and efforts to contact the parent, methods of interaction between the caseworker and the parent, and the parent’s expressed desire or actions/inactions.<br><br>d. The parents’ whereabouts are unknown despite concerted efforts to locate them. Concerted efforts means a monthly attempt at locating the parent using one of the following:<br><br>(1) Interviews with Child and Family Team members.<br>(2) Interviews with extended family.<br>(3) Interviews with the child.<br>(4) Checking allied agency records (Department of Workforce Services, Office of Recovery Services, law enforcement, etc.).<br>(5) On-line person locator searches.<br>(6) Other sources not listed here that the caseworker or the team becomes aware of.<br><br>e.

Monthly Home Visit: The caseworker will check on the residence where the child is living and observe and document the general conditions pertaining to threats of harm, child vulnerabilities, and protective capacities of the caregivers. The caseworker will not enter a home for the purpose of a visit without a caregiver present, unless the child’s caregiver has granted permission. This approval should be documented. The caseworker may enter the family’s home in an emergency without a caregiver’s permission.

If the parents do not agree with the Child and Family Plan, DCFS will strive to resolve the disagreement with the parents. If the disagreement is not resolved, DCFS will inform the court of the disagreement.</p><p>C. Parent/child involvement in the development of the Child and Family Plan. Child and Family Team Meetings and/or monthly interviews between the caseworker and parent may provide the parent with the opportunity to provide input into the development of the plan.

The substitute caregiver(s) that has been identified as the person(s) who will be imminently providing enduring permanency for the child.</li><li data-start=\"5166\" data-end=\"6936\">Exceptions for parental involvement include:<br>a. The parent is deceased.<br>b. Parental rights are terminated.<br>c. Parent’s active or passive refusal to participate.<br>(1) Active Refusal: Parent expresses verbally or in writing that they are not interested in participating in the development of the plan. In this case, the caseworker must verify with the parent that they still decline participation before every new plan is finalized.<br>(2) Passive Refusal: Parent indicates a passive refusal to participate in the plan development through their actions or inactions, such as failing to keep appointments or returning messages. In this case, the caseworker must make at least two attempts to contact the parent face-to-face, by phone, or by correspondence every time a new plan is developed to provide them opportunity to participate in the development of the plan.<br>(3) The caseworker will document the dates and efforts to involve the parent, methods of interaction between the caseworker and the parent, and the parent’s expressed desire.<br>d. The parents’ whereabouts are unknown despite concerted efforts to locate them. Concerted efforts means a monthly attempt at locating the parent using one of the following:<br>(1) Interviews with Child and Family Team members.<br>(2) Interviews with extended family.<br>(3) Interviews with the child.<br>(4) Checking allied agency records (Department of Workforce Services, Office of Recovery Services, law enforcement, etc.).<br>(5) Online person locator searches.<br>(6) Other sources not listed here that the caseworker or the team becomes aware of.<br>e.

A developmentally appropriate child means they have the ability to understand and offer relevant contributions to the plan or express preferential considerations within the selection of services or objectives. As a general guideline, children who are elementary school aged are regarded as being capable of contributing to the plan to some extent unless otherwise developmentally incapable.<br>b. Contributions offered by the child will be considered by the team and included in the plan based on the Child and Family Team’s determination of the appropriateness of the request.</li><li data-start=\"7729\" data-end=\"8262\">The child’s court appointed Guardian ad Litem will be involved in the development of a child’s Child and Family Plan. The Guardian ad Litem will be invited to any Child and Family Team Meeting held to develop, review, or modify the Child and Family Plan.<br>a. Caseworkers will continue to schedule Child and Family Team Meetings around the needs of the child and family and will invite the Guardian ad Litem.<br>b. It is not required that the Guardian ad Litem be in attendance in order to hold the Child and Family Team Meeting.</li><li data-start=\"8263\" data-end=\"8875\">Other parties may be involved in the development of the Child and Family Plan, as determined appropriate by the Child and Family Team. DCFS may not prohibit others, such as the parent’s attorney, from being involved in the development of the plan. Utah Code Ann. §80-3-307 allows parties and their legal counsel to participate in the development of the plan if their participation is otherwise permitted by law. Before prohibiting anyone from participating in the development of a Child and Family Plan, the caseworker will staff the situation with an Assistant Attorney General to see if this is permissible.</li></ol><p>D. Upon finalization of the Child and Family Plan, both the caseworker and supervisor will sign the plan. The caseworker will obtain signatures from the parents, child, and out-of-home caregiver. If any party refuses to sign the plan, reasons will be documented in the activity logs of the case file. Once all signatures have been obtained, copies of the plan will be sent to the Juvenile Court, Assistant Attorney General, Guardian ad Litem, legal counsel for the parents, parents, child, and out-of-home caregiver.</p><p>E. Concurrent permanency planning ensures that the child and family are prepared for both the child’s primary and secondary permanency goals. Every Child and Family Plan must include a primary and secondary goal.</p><p>F. Tracking and adapting the Child and Family Plan/team review/progress summaries:</p><ol data-start=\"9694\" data-end=\"10509\"><li data-start=\"9694\" data-end=\"10189\">With input from Child and Family Team members, the plan will be reviewed to track progress made and progress will be reported at least every 90 days.<br>a. The progress summary will outline the current situation and progress towards the permanency goal.<br>b. The progress summary will be signed by both the caseworker and supervisor and will be submitted to the Juvenile Court, Assistant Attorney General, Guardian ad Litem, legal counsel for the parents, parents, and out-of-home caregiver.</li><li data-start=\"10190\" data-end=\"10509\">The plan will be adapted:<br>a. When the team identifies that new steps are needed to make progress.<br>b. When the team identifies a new need.<br>c. When needs are met.<br>d.

A foster care case will<br>not be opened on a CPS removal unless DCFS is granted temporary custody, adjudicated<br>custody, or voluntary custody.

The region may have additional expectations of the RFC beyond those described here; however, these guidelines are the minimum requirements expected of an RFC. The RFC provides support for placements with resource families that are licensed through the DHHS, Office of Licensing (OL) for general foster care (LFC). This section does not pertain to support for resource homes which are certified through contract providers or resource homes that are licensed for a specific child (LSC). Under the conditions of the contract, contract providers are responsible to provide support to the homes they certify. DCFS staff, who possess an LSC license, with an expertise in supporting kinship homes will provide the support for families.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Definitions</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A. RFC – An employee of DCFS who is responsible for providing support for placements of children in out-of-home care with families that are licensed with a LFC license through the OL.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Practice Guidelines</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The following items describe the minimum role and expectations for the RFC.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A. The RFC will be familiar with the procedures and requirements necessary for a family to become a licensed out-of-home care provider and sustain licensure. These requirements include basic licensing standards outlined by the OL, Background Screening Requirements, the Provider Code of Conduct, and the pre-service and ongoing training requirements.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">B. The RFC will assist licensed resource families with tracking their number of in-service training hours in order to assist them in acquiring the required number of in-service hours needed for re-licensure.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">C. The RFC will be familiar with the procedures outlined in Practice Guidelines <a href=\"https://fostercaresystems.byu.edu/rules/UT/50\">Section 305</a>, “DCFS relationship with Out-of-Home Caregiver”, and <a href=\"/foster/ut-utah-department-health-and-human-services-division-children-and-family-services-102\">Section 306</a>, “Emergencies and Serious Situations.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">D. Each RFC is responsible for becoming familiar with and forming a working relationship with the resource families assigned to them. The RFC will develop knowledge of the strengths and needs of each resource family in regards to caring for a child in the custody of DCFS. The knowledge of the resource family will assist the RFC in facilitating a successful placement of a child in the custody of DCFS with the resource family.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">1. The RFC is responsible for visiting newly licensed foster homes within 30 days or sooner of DCFS receiving the home study, in order to generally assess the type of child that the resource family may be successful with. Ideally, the visit should be conducted prior to the resource family having a child placed in their home.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">2. The RFC is responsible for ongoing assessment of each resource family’s ability to care for a child in the custody of DCFS. Any significant information that the RFC learns regarding the family’s ability to provide quality care for a child will be documented in the Provider notes in SAFE. The RFC will also assess how significant life changes that occur in a family, such as births, deaths, adoption, divorce, etc., may impact the family’s ability to continue to provide care for children in the custody of DCFS.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">3. The RFC is responsible for ensuring that they document any relevant information regarding the family they may learn from the OL and/or the Utah Foster Care regarding licensure, training, etc.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">4. The RFC will provide any information that they become aware of to the OL that may be relevant to or may affect the licensure of the resource family.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">a. If a foster home has not had a placement for more than 12 months after the date of the last OL inspection, the RFC will notify OL in order for them to conduct an inspection of the residence.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">b. RFCs will notify OL when a newly licensed home has taken their first placement in order for OL to assess if an inspection is needed at that time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">5. When the caseworker and/or RFC identifies a safety concern with the foster home, the RFC will inform OL of the concerns and OL will follow up with the home to determine if any conditions shall be made to the license.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">6. Minimum standards of contact with the resource family:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">a. Monthly Contact: At minimum, the RFC is required to have monthly contact with each resource family they oversee. This may include a phone call, email, letter, or face-to-face contact with the resource family.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">b. Face-to-Face Home Visits: The RFC is required to conduct a visit in the home of each resource family they oversee a minimum of once every six months, being more attentive to the resource homes with current placements of children. The RFC will document a summary of the home visit in the Provider Module of SAFE.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">(1) Exceptions for the six-month face-to-face home visit may be made for resource families that are not currently being utilized (are “on hold”) due to personal issues, a recent adoption, etc. If a family that is “on-hold” expresses that they want to resume taking placements, the RFC must make a face-to-face visit in the home prior to a child being placed there.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">c. The RFC may determine that it is necessary to have more frequent contact with a resource family based on the specific needs and vulnerabilities of a child placed in the home, as well as the protective capacities of the resource family.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">d. The region may require more than the minimum standards of contact between the RFC and the resource families they serve if a determination is made that the region has the resources and capacity for more frequent contact.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">E. Using the knowledge they possess of the resource families, the RFC assists the caseworker in finding and facilitating a placement match for a child in the custody of DCFS with a licensed resource home. The placement decision should take into account factors that are in the child’s best interest when making a placement decision, including but not limited to the skills of the foster parent; proximity to the home the child was removed from; the potential that the child may be placed with kin; the ability of the resource family to maintain siblings together; the proximity to the child’s home school; and the permanency goal, including enduring safety and permanency for the child.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">1. When possible, it is best practice for the RFC to assist the caseworker in facilitating a pre-placement meeting regarding the specific needs of the child prior to placement of the child in the home.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">2. The RFC may assist the caseworker in providing information to the resource family regarding the child prior to the placement of the child in the home. The RFC will document providing the information to the resource family in the activity logs of the child’s case in SAFE and will use the correct policy attachment when documenting that this step was completed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">F. The RFC will assist the caseworker in supporting and maintaining the placement of a child with a resource family. The RFC may also assist in preventing possible placement disruptions.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">1. The RFC is responsible for knowing what resources are available to help support and maintain a child’s placement in the home of a resource family, as well as how to help the resource family access those resources.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">2. The RFC may attend Child and Family Team Meetings, court, and home visits with the caseworker. The RFC may also assist with the process of preparing a family for adoption, if appropriate.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">3. The RFC will be included as an integral part of the Child and Family Team, when the need arises, in order to assist the team in understanding and/or planning for placement transitions and issues regarding permanency for the child.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">4. The RFC may assist the resource family in developing an understanding of DCFS’ procedures and Practice Guidelines, especially when the resource family has questions and/or concerns.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">5. The RFC may assist the resource family in finding a respite provider when needed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">6. In the event that a related-parties’ investigation is initiated regarding a resource family, the RFC may provide answers to general questions regarding policies and procedures and may listen to concerns the provider may have in order to provide empathy as they go through the investigative process. The RFC may not, however, provide any information to the provider regarding the specifics of the investigation. In addition, the RFC has an obligation to provide any information to the CPS investigator that they believe may be relevant to the investigation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">7. The RFC assists the caseworker in ensuring that the health care requirements for the child are communicated to the resource family and may assist the caseworker in following up with the family to ensure that medical and mental health requirements for the child are completed in a timely manner.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">8. The RFC will ensure that the Foster Care Agreement (Form 638A) is completed on an annual basis, upon re-licensure of the resource family. As a part of this process, the RFC will obtain an email address from each resource family and will enter the email address into the provider window in SAFE.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">G. The RFC is responsible for developing and maintaining appropriate and professional partnerships with community partners, especially when it relates to maintaining a child in the home of an appropriate resource family and/or providing services to prevent placement disruption.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">H. The RFC will attend, be prepared for, and actively participate in the placement committee when a resource family they are assigned to is presented as a potential match for a child needing placement.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I. The RFC will attend cluster meetings and other foster parents’ activities when possible (at a minimum once a year) in order to build relationships with the families they serve, offer support to foster parents, answer questions, and understand issues faced by resource families.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">J. The RFC will help resource families understand how to act in a professional manner at all times when representing themselves as a foster parent. This includes when they are interacting with others in the community as well as on social networking sites.</p>\n  </div>"

Navigating areas of practice that are specific to the unique needs of child and adolescent development and the formation of personal identity can be confusing and challenging. The following practices guide the caseworker and other staff in helping youth bridge the gap between knowing they are safe and feeling they are safe while receiving DCFS services.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Practice Guidelines</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A. Confidentiality, safety, and disclosure:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">1.Youth who are DCFS involved may disclose information pertaining to their personal believe system or identity formation to DCFS staff that the youth may want to keep private for reasons pertaining to privacy and feelings of personal safety. This information shall be treated with care. Caseworkers have a responsibility to protect the privacy of youth unless the information disclosed falls under the following:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">a. Duty to report child abuse or neglect;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">b. Safety of the child or another individual;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">c. Medical or other information requiring disclosure under a parent’s rights or residual parental rights. [See: Practice Guideline Section 308.2.]</p><p dir=\"ltr\">d. Without consent from the youth’s parent, guardian, or custodian, the caseworker may not refer to the youth in records in a way that is contrary to the youth’s biological sex. [See: Utah Code Ann. §80-2-309]</p><p dir=\"ltr\">2. The caseworker will make every effort to include the youth in decision making on their behalf. This includes decisions regarding privacy, normative child and adolescent development, individualized needs in placement, interventions the youth is being asked to participate in, goals specific to the youth, and identifying support persons to be a part of their Child and Family Team.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">3. The caseworker will support the youth in identifying trusted individuals within their lives who can provide a consistent and safe relationship to support the youth in their physical and emotional well-being and feelings of personal safety.

When a youth makes a disclosure that they wish to remain private, the caseworker will assess the disclosure for the criteria mentioned above and inform the youth of any mandated reporting requirements. The caseworker will invite the youth to participate in the reporting of this information to the extent that it is developmentally appropriate and safe for the youth to do so.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">5. If the youth in out of home care discloses to the caseworker information regarding the youth’s asserted gender identity or sexual orientation, and the youth wants the information to remain private, the caseworker will develop a plan in cooperation with the youth’s therapist or counselor to disclose the information to the parents.

The caseworker will help the youth be prepared for the disclosure to their therapist, and will allow the youth to participate in this disclosure if possible (e.g., allowing the youth to help compose an email to the therapist, assisting the youth in having a phone call with the therapist, or caseworker attending a portion of a therapeutic session with the youth).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">7. If the youth does not yet have a therapist, the caseworker will make all efforts to refer the youth to a therapist that practices in areas specific to the youth’s unique needs and development.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">8.

The caseworker will then follow the recommendations of the youth’s therapist.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">10. Activity logs and other documentation should not reflect confidential information relating to a youth’s personal belief system and identity formation, but should note disclosure of the confidential information and what steps were taken to support the youth in this disclosure, including staffing this information with their supervisor and making a referral to therapeutic services to help a youth navigate areas pertaining to child and adolescent development, healthy identity formation, and feelings of personal safety.</p>\n  </div>"

A case finding of Unsupported will not be made solely because the CPS caseworker was unable to identify the alleged perpetrator when the evidence shows that abuse, neglect, or dependency occurred.</p><p>I. The determination of acceptable findings will be based on the facts of the case obtained at the time of the investigation.</p><p>J. An allegation will not be considered Unsupported or Without Merit because the family corrected the conditions that caused the abuse, neglect, or dependency while the investigation was pending.</p><p>K. The conclusions of the health care professional regarding an abusive injury, sexual abuse, or medical neglect will be considered by the CPS caseworker in making case findings. DCFS and the family may obtain a second opinion. If the family requests a second opinion, they must do so at their own expense.</p><p>L.

Any other children residing in the home or cared for by the same caretaker that are reasonably likely to have also been subjected to similar abuse/neglect based on the specific shared circumstances, or are reasonably likely to be subjected to abuse/neglect having the ability to communicate verbally or through another reliable means (i.e., communication board, American Sign Language, writing, etc.) will be interviewed to assess risk, protection, and safety needs.

An infant or child who is non-verbal will be observed and assessed according to <a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/46sgdxzenzpg19qzins231hxgn7jfp4w\">Section 202.4</a>. The child must be awake for the CPS caseworker to satisfy the face-to-face requirement. This must be clearly documented. A CPS caseworker will not conduct an interview with a child by telephonic means (i.e., e-mail, telephone, etc.). The interview will take place outside the presence of the alleged perpetrator. The CPS caseworker may request a courtesy caseworker conduct a personal interview or to observe the child if the caseworker would have to travel an unreasonable distance to see the child.</p><ol><li>Support person:<ol><li>The CPS caseworker will assess the child’s level of comfort with the interview and will make reasonable efforts to ensure the child is comfortable.<br>(1) The CPS caseworker will ask if the child is comfortable being alone in the interview with the interviewer.<br>(2) If the child is not comfortable being alone in the interview, the CPS caseworker shall conduct the interview with a support person of the child’s choice.<br>(3) The CPS caseworker will make reasonable efforts to arrange for the support person to be present for the interview.<br>(4) The CPS caseworker will capture this conversation as part of their recording.<br>(5) If the CPS caseworker is assisting law enforcement in the context of a crimignal investigation, law enforcement will make the decision whether or not to allow the child to have a support person present during the law enforcement interview.</li><li>The support person will:<br>(1) be an adult over the age of 18 years;<br>(2) be reasonably available;<br>(3) be willing and able to be present in the interview without influencing the child through statements or reactions; and<br>(4) not sit in line of sight of the child during the interview.</li><li>The support person may include, but is not limited to:<br>(1) school teacher or administrator;<br>(2) guidance counselor;<br>(3) child care provider;<br>(4) family member;<br>(5) family advocate; or<br>(6) clergy.</li><li>The support person may not be a person:<br>(1) who is alleged to be, or potentially may be, the alleged perpetrator; or<br>(2) is protective of the perpetrator or unsupportive of the child.</li><li>The CPS caseworker will provide a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220527060010/https://public.powerdms.com/UTAHDHS/documents/1031419\">CPS05 Support Person Form</a> for the support person to sign.

In all other instances where the alleged perpetrator is known, the parent or guardian must be notified prior to the initial interview with the child.</li><li>If the alleged perpetrator is unknown or if the alleged perpetrator’s relationship to the child’s family is unknown, the CPS caseworker may conduct a minimal interview, not to exceed 15 minutes from the time the interview begins with the child prior to notification of the interview to the child’s parent. This is designed to allow the CPS caseworker to determine whether or not the parent, stepparent, or parent’s paramour is the alleged perpetrator. If the initial disclosure made by the child implicates a parent, stepparent, or parent’s paramour, the interview is not limited in duration. Notification may take the form of a phone call documented in activity records and does not mean permission or approval. The information imparted to the parent/guardian will include the specific allegations and the time and place of the interview with the child. If criminal activity is disclosed, the CPS caseworker will coordinate with law enforcement prior to notification of the parents so as not to impede the criminal investigation.</li><li>The CPS caseworker will notify the parent as soon as practicable after the child has been interviewed, but in no case later than 24 hours after the interview has taken place.</li><li>The parent will be notified prior to any subsequent interviews of the child.</li><li>Exceptions to notification prior to interview may include:<ol><li>Notice to the parent would threaten the safety of a non-offending parent, the children, or other involved individuals;</li><li>A parent is incarcerated or there are other legal barriers to notification (such as court orders, police requests, etc.);</li><li>If the child is in foster care at the time of the interview;</li><li>A new allegation or incident involving the parent, stepparent, or parent’s paramour where they have been identified as the alleged perpetrator.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Disclosure of criminal activity: If the disclosure made by the child gives reasonable cause to believe that the child has been the alleged victim of criminal activity, the CPS caseworker will immediately contact law enforcement.</li><li>Suicidal ideation: Refer to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220120223804/https://public.powerdms.com/UTAHDHS/documents/275063\">Section 700</a> if concerns regarding suicide are identified in the referral or during an interview.</li></ol><p>C. Parent/guardian:</p><ol><li>The child’s natural parents or other guardian will be personally interviewed regardless of residence, unless their whereabouts are unknown. If the child’s natural parents or other guardian are incarcerated at the time of the investigation, they do not need to be personally interviewed. This interview maybe conducted with only one parent. Investigation and interview exceptions are as follows:<ol><li>Parent(s)/guardian(s) are incarcerated.</li><li>Caseworker is unable to locate parent(s) or guardian(s).</li><li>Parent(s)/guardian(s) are non-cooperative.<br>Documentation of reasons for not interviewing a parent are required.</li></ol></li><li>Each specific allegation will be discussed. Admissions or denials will be documented in the activity recording.</li><li>The parents will be asked about the child’s eligibility for or membership in a Native American tribe.</li></ol><p>D. Third party/collateral contacts:</p><ol><li>Third party/collateral contacts having had direct association with the child, or who are otherwise knowledgeable about the child’s safety and family’s functioning, will be interviewed.</li><li>If a third party or collateral contact is identified as an eyewitness or has first-hand knowledge of the child’s safety and family’s functioning, an interview will be conducted, including siblings. If the third party can only speak to the allegations, the CPS caseworker must speak to others who know about the family’s functioning.</li><li>If the third party is a professional (i.e., medical, therapist, school, law enforcement) who has provided the CPS caseworker with a report and the report clearly details the third parties’ involvement with the child/family, the report will be sufficient and an interview need not be conducted. The CPS caseworker will upload the report into content management. If the report is not sufficient or there are additional questions that need to be asked of the third party, an interview shall be conducted.</li><li>For cases where it is verified the alleged perpetrator does not/will not have access to the child and there is no identified third party/collateral contact that can provide additional information regarding the case or safety of the child, a third party contact is not needed.</li></ol><p>E. Alleged perpetrator:</p><ol><li>The alleged perpetrator will be interviewed by the CPS caseworker.</li><li>When the alleged perpetrator resides in the home of the child or has access to the child, and when law enforcement has requested that the CPS caseworker not conduct an interview regarding the allegations, the alleged perpetrator will not be interviewed by the CPS caseworker until the interview is cleared by law enforcement.</li><li>The CPS caseworker will not be obligated to conduct an interview when:<ol><li>Law enforcement requests the CPS caseworker not conduct an interview due to a pending criminal investigation in these cases. CPS will communicate with law enforcement the need to have law enforcement interview within CPS investigation time frames.</li><li>The alleged perpetrator's identity or location is unknown.</li><li>The safety of the child or the CPS caseworker is a concern, or in domestic violence cases when the safety of the non-offending parent is a concern, as determined by the reasonable request of the non-offending parent.</li><li>The alleged perpetrator is incarcerated during the course of the CPS investigation.</li></ol></li><li>If the alleged perpetrator is a juvenile:<ol><li>The CPS caseworker will seek the permission of the juvenile’s parent or guardian prior to the interview.</li><li>Whether CPS or law enforcement is conducting the interview, all requests for interviews of children in the custody of DCFS will be referred to the Guardian ad Litem assigned to the child. If there is no Guardian ad Litem appointed for the child, the CPS caseworker will refer the request to region administration. If the interview is part of a criminal investigation or could become part of a criminal investigation, either interviewer would need to seek the permission of the Guardian ad Litem prior to conducting an interview of a minor in custody who is an alleged perpetrator. If the Guardian ad Litem does not consent to the interview, the CPS caseworker will contact the Assistant Attorney General. [See: Practice Guidelines <a href=\"/foster/ut-utah-department-health-and-human-services-division-children-and-family-services-109\">Section 306.7</a>.]</li><li>The CPS caseworker will interview a parent or guardian of the juvenile perpetrator for the purpose of gathering additional information.</li><li>The CPS caseworker will not be obligated to conduct an interview with the juvenile perpetrator or their family when law enforcement conducts these interviews and provides CPS with enough information to complete the significant risk assessment and determine whether or not any safety concerns exist.</li><li>At the conclusion of the investigation, assess the past victimization of the juvenile perpetrator and refer for appropriate treatment.</li></ol></li></ol><p>F. Interview exceptions: The CPS caseworker may rely on a written report of a prior interview rather than conducting an additional interview if:</p><ol><li>Law enforcement has previously conducted a timely and thorough investigation regarding the alleged abuse, neglect, or dependency and has produced a written report. When law enforcement requests that CPS conduct no interview, the CPS caseworker may review the case with a supervisor for evaluation and determination of the next step.</li><li>The investigation included one or more of the interviews required by Utah Code Ann. §80-2-702.1735</li><li>It is determined that an additional interview is not in the best interest of the child.</li></ol><p>G. Additional victims revealed: If during the course of an interview a child reveals the possibility of another alleged victim of abuse or neglect, the CPS caseworker will do the following:</p><ol><li>The CPS caseworker will ask the child for further clarification regarding the identity of the additional alleged victim.</li><li>If the CPS caseworker is able to identify the additional alleged victim or a means for locating this alleged victim, and the victim is identified as a child residing outside the home of the primary victim, the CPS caseworker will contact the Intake office to determine if the allegations meet the criteria for opening a new case.</li><li>If the CPS caseworker is able to identify the additional alleged victim or a means for locating this alleged victim, and the victim is a sibling residing in the same home as the primary victim, the new victim will be added to the existing CPS case if the allegation meets the criteria for investigation.</li><li>If the child does not reveal the name of the additional alleged victim or does not provide a means for locating this alleged victim, the CPS caseworker will make efforts to try to identify the additional alleged victim with the limited information acquired. This may include talking with a collateral contact, parent, or relative that may know the identity of the additional alleged victim.</li><li>If the CPS caseworker is unable to identify the additional alleged victim mentioned in the interview, the CPS caseworker will contact the Intake office to provide the information that is available.</li><li>The Intake worker will determine if there is additional information available through data inquiries that may assist in identifying the additional alleged victim.</li><li>If the Intake worker is able to identify the identity of the additional alleged victim and the information meets the criteria for investigation, Intake will open the case.</li><li>If the Intake worker is unable to identify the additional alleged victim, the Intake worker will notify the CPS caseworker calling in the referral that the case has been unaccepted so that the referring CPS caseworker can document this information in the case logs.</li></ol>\n  </div>"

Every effort must be taken to find missing children and to prevent children from running or being abducted. It is imperative to locate children who are missing. Once located, the children should be assessed for human trafficking, and provided holistic services that meet their needs, including addressing any trauma that may have occurred during the missing, runaway, or abduction period.</p><p>Since 2012, there has been an increase in the awareness and prevalence of runaway and homeless children, particularly children involved in child welfare systems. Increased awareness includes the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC), known as human trafficking. These guidelines are intended to help caseworkers incorporate best practices for working with runaway or missing children, homeless children, and children who are victims of CSEC.</p><hr><p><strong>Applicable Laws</strong><br>Federal Law: 42 U.S.C. 671(a)(35)(B)<br>Federal Law: 22 U.S.C. 7102<br>Utah Code Ann. §80-2-301. Division responsibilities.<br>Utah Code Ann. §76-5-307 to 310.1. Definitions and human trafficking for labor, sexual exploitation, and penalties.<br>Utah Code Ann. §76-10-1302. Prostitution.<br>Utah Code Ann. §76-10-1315. Safe harbor for children as victims in commercial sex or sexual solicitation.</p><p>Practice Guidelines<br>A. Definitions:</p><ol><li>Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC): Occurs when individuals buy, trade, or sell sexual acts with a child. Sex trafficking is the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purposes of a commercial sex act. Children who are involved in the commercial sex industry are viewed as victims of severe forms of trafficking of persons, which is sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age. A commercial sex act is any sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person.</li><li>Runaway: A minor, other than an emancipated minor, who is absent from the home or lawfully prescribed residence of the parent or legal guardian of the minor without the permission of the parent or legal guardian.</li><li>Homeless: An individual who lacks housing.</li><li>Missing: Federal law (34 U.S.C. §11292) a “missing child” is “any individual less than 18 years of age whose whereabouts are unknown to such individual’s parent” or legal guardian. This broad definition includes “children who may have (1) been abducted by a non-family member; (2) wrongfully taken or retained by a person related to them; (3) wandered away from a safe environment and become lost; (4) been displaced by disaster; (5) run away from a home, foster home, or state care facility; or (6) otherwise gone missing for any reason at all.”</li><li>Abducted: Utah Code Ann. §78b-16-102: “the wrongful removal or wrongful retention of a child.” For the purpose of this guideline, this term also includes Child Kidnapped in Utah Code §76-5-301.1 and Kidnapping in Utah Code §76-5-301.</li><li>Child Kidnapped: Utah Code Ann. §76-5-301.1: “An actor commits child kidnapping if the actor intentionally or knowingly, without authority of law, and by any means and in any manner, seizes, confines, detains, or transports a child under the age of 14 without the consent of the victim's parent or guardian, or the consent of a person acting in loco parentis.”</li><li>Kidnapping: Utah Code Ann. §76-5-301: “An actor commits kidnapping if the actor intentionally or knowingly, without authority of law, and against the will of the victim:<ol><li>detains or restrains the victim for any substantial period of time.</li><li>detains or restrains the victim in circumstances exposing the victim to risk of bodily injury.</li><li>holds the victim in involuntary servitude.</li><li>detains or restrains a minor without the consent of the minor's parent or legal guardian or the consent of a person acting in loco parentis, if the minor is 14 years of age or older but younger than 18 years of age; or</li><li>moves the victim any substantial distance or across a state line.”</li></ol></li></ol><p>B. If at any point during the CPS investigation, the caseworker determines the child is being trafficked or is at risk of being trafficked, the caseworker will continue to follow the appropriate CPS guidelines for their investigation and will also include the following in the case process:</p><ol><li>The caseworker will share information regarding services that are available to individuals that are being trafficked or at risk of being trafficked.<ol><li>Provide the caregiver and the child with information for the National Runaway Safeline to call or live chat at 1-800-runaway or <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250428150422/https://www.1800runaway.org/\">www.1800runaway.org</a>.</li><li>Identify a safe place for the child to go if they run (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250426190603/https://www.nationalsafeplace.org/\">www.nationalsafeplace.org</a>).</li><li>Refer to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250428185631/https://www.missingkids.org/home\">https://www.missingkids.org/</a> for information regarding missing and exploited children.</li><li>Refer to 211 resources.</li></ol></li><li>Provide specific treatment and therapy available to individuals being trafficked.</li><li>Safety plan with the caregiver to address the trafficking concerns if there is no concern with trafficking for individuals in the home.</li><li>If the caregiver is the alleged perpetrator, the caseworker must:<ol><li>Staff the case with their supervisor immediately to determine the next course of action.</li><li>Staff with the AAG.</li><li>Contact law enforcement if they are not already aware of the circumstance.</li></ol></li></ol><p>C. Response if the child is missing, has run away, or has been abducted during the investigation:</p><ol><li>The caseworker will staff the case with their supervisor and the child’s caregiver to determine if the child is missing, has run away, or has been abducted. The caseworker will strive to make this determination within two hours of receiving notification.</li><li>If it is determined that the child is missing, has run away, or has been abducted, the caseworker will work with the caregiver to file a Missing Persons Report immediately with the law enforcement agency where the child resides and supply the law enforcement agency with any necessary information that will promote the safe return of the child.<ol><li>The caseworker will work with law enforcement to determine if an Amber Alert should be issued.</li><li>The caseworker will obtain a case record (police report and number) from the law enforcement agency and request that law enforcement place the child on the National Crime Information Center (NCIC).</li></ol></li><li>The caseworker will work with the caregiver to report the child as missing to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children by going to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220120103802/https://cmfc.missingkids.org/reportit/\">https://cmfc.missingkids.org/reportit</a> within 24 hours of it being known that the child is missing, has run away, or has been abducted and follow the directions online to create a user account. The caseworker will gather case information and relevant materials before starting the report process. Basic information the person filing the report will be asked to provide includes:<ol><li>Child's full name.</li><li>Child's date of birth.</li><li>Date child went missing.</li><li>City and state from where child went missing.</li><li>Guardian information including agency name, and telephone; and</li><li>Law enforcement information including agency name and telephone.</li><li>A photo of the child.</li><li>A description of the child’s physical features, such as:<br>(1) height.<br>(2) weight.<br>(3) gender.<br>(4) ethnicity/race.<br>(5) hair color.<br>(6) eye color.</li><li>Endangerment information such as:<br>(1) pregnancy status.<br>(2) prescription medications.<br>(3) suicidal tendencies.<br>(4) vulnerability to being sex trafficked.<br>(5) other health and risk factors.</li><li>Circumstances surrounding the incident.</li><li>Description of any person who may be with the child.</li></ol></li></ol><p>D. Once the child is located, and the CPS case is still open, the caseworker will:</p><ol><li>Determine the primary factors that caused or contributed to the child’s absence from their home and continue the investigation as outlined in practice guidelines.</li><li>Remove or assist the caregiver in removing the child from the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children website (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220120103802/https://cmfc.missingkids.org/reportit/\">https://cmfc.missingkids.org/reportit/</a>).</li><li>Request to interview the child to assess if the child is a victim of trafficking. This interview will most likely occur at a CJC. If not, the caseworker will use the forensic interviewing model when interviewing the child.</li><li>The caseworker will assess for the items listed below during the interview: “While your whereabouts were unknown:<ol><li>did someone control, supervise, or monitor your work/actions?”</li><li>could you leave your job or work situation if you want to?”\\</li><li>was your communication ever restricted or monitored?”\\</li><li>were you able to access medical care?”</li><li>were you ever allowed to leave the place you were living/working?”</li><li>under what conditions?”</li><li>was your movement outside of your residence/workplace ever monitored or controlled?”</li><li>what did you think would have happened if you left the situation?”</li><li>was there ever a time when you wanted to leave, but felt that you could not?”</li><li>what do you think would have happened if you left without telling anyone?”</li><li>did you feel it was your only option to stay in the situation?”</li><li>did anyone ever force you to do something physically or sexually that you didn’t feel comfortable doing?”</li><li>were you ever physically abused (shoved, slapped, hit, kicked, scratched, punched, burned, etc.) by anyone?”</li><li>were you ever sexually abused (sexual assault/unwanted touching, rape, sexual exploitation, etc.) by anyone?”</li><li>did anyone ever introduce you to or provide you with drugs, alcohol, or medications?”<br>Resources: “Screening Tool for Victims of Human Trafficking,” U.S.<br>Department of Health and Human Services,<br><a href=\"https://wustl.box.com/s/ot91tvgtva5xpwz6btcbfrielwhtjh27\">http://www.justice.gov/usao/ian/htrt/health_screen_questions.pdf.</a></li></ol></li><li>If during the interview, the child discloses that CSEC or other human trafficking has occurred and the interview is not being recorded at a CJC, discontinue the interview, explaining to the child the importance of the information they are sharing and the need to change the venue for the interview. Schedule an interview at the CJC.</li><li>If the child reports that they may be victims of trafficking, the caseworker will access the appropriate resources to address the child’s needs. This includes:<ol><li>Informing the caregiver that the child may be a victim of trafficking.</li><li>Reporting to law enforcement within 24 hours that the child may be a victim of CSEC or human trafficking and assisting in the investigation.</li><li>Accessing the appropriate mental health care, preferably providing a therapist that specializes in treating victims of CSEC.</li><li>Referring to resources listed in Section B, above.</li></ol></li></ol><p>E. If as the time approaches for case closure the child is still missing, has run away, or has been abducted, the caseworker will staff the case with their supervisor and AAG, if needed, to determine if all resources have been exhausted in locating the child and to determine if the case will be closed. This may include, but is not limited to, working with law enforcement, family, out of state resources, and other entities involved with the youth. The caseworker will also assess, if the child does return home, if there is a safety concern in the home they would be returning to and how to address the safety concerns. The caseworker will document all efforts in the case.</p><p>F. If the caseworker is notified that the child has been located after the CPS case has closed, the caseworker will staff the case with the supervisor to determine if the prior case should be reopened, or if human trafficking is suspected, if a new case should be initiated through Intake.</p>\n  </div>"

To enable caseworkers to help families meet their permanency, protection, and well-being goals, Child and Family Services provides a flexible organization that encourages team members to apply persistent effort, devise creative solutions, and do what is needed to provide effective services to the children and families they serve.</p><hr><p><br><strong>Applicable Law</strong><br>Utah Code Ann. §80-2-301. Division responsibilities.</p><p><strong>Practice Principles</strong><br>A. Principle One - Protection. Children's safety is paramount; children and adults have a right to live free from abuse.</p><p>B. Principle Two - Development. Children and families need consistent nurturing in a healthy environment to achieve their developmental potential.</p><p>C. Principle Three - Permanency. All children need and are entitled to enduring relationships that provide a family, stability, belonging, and a sense of self that connects children to their past, present, and future.</p><p>D. Principle Four - Cultural Responsiveness. Children and families are to be understood within the context of their own family rules, traditions, history, and culture.</p><p>E. Principle Five - Partnership. The entire community shares the responsibility to create an environment that helps families raise children to their fullest potential.</p><p>F. Principle Six - Organizational Competence. Committed, qualified, trained, and skilled staff, supported by an effectively structured organization, helps ensure positive outcomes for children and families.</p><p>G. Principle Seven - Professional Competence. Children and families need a relationship with an accepting, concerned, empathetic caseworker who can confront difficult issues and effectively assist them in their process toward positive change.</p><p><strong>Practice Skills</strong><br>Key practice skills have been formulated from the Practice Model Principles to \"Put Our Values Into Action.\" Practice Model related training will provide for the development of these practice skills. Basic skills include:</p><p>A. Engaging. The skill of effectively establishing a relationship with children, parents, and essential individuals for the purpose of sustaining the work that is to be accomplished together.</p><p>B. Teaming. The skill of assembling a group to work with children and families, becoming a member of an established group, or leading a group may all be necessary for success in bringing needed resources to the critical issues of children and families. Child welfare is a community effort and requires a team.</p><p>C. Assessing. The skill of obtaining information about the salient events that brought the children and families into our services and the underlying causes bringing about their situations. This discovery process looks for the issues to be addressed and the strengths within the children and families to address these issues. Here we are determining the capability, willingness, and availability of resources for achieving safety, permanence, and well-being for children.</p><p>D. Planning. The skills necessary to tailor the planning process uniquely to each child and family. Assessment will overlap into this area. This includes the design of incremental steps that move children and families from where they are to a better level of functioning. Service planning requires the planning cycle of assessing circumstances and resources, making decisions on directions to take, evaluating the effectiveness of the plan, reworking the plan as needed, celebrating successes, and facing consequences in response to lack of improvement.</p><p>E. Intervening. The skills to intercede with actions that will decrease risk, provide for safety, promote permanence, and establish well-being. These skills continue to be gathered throughout the life of the professional child welfare caseworker and may range from finding housing to changing a parent's pattern of thinking about their child.</p><p><strong>Practice Standards</strong><br>Following are general practice standards that cross program boundaries. Together with practice principles and skills these standards will help caseworkers understand their roles and responsibilities. Standards will give guidance to caseworkers as they provide services and strive to achieve safety and permanence for each child and family member they help.</p><p>Child and Family Services is a trauma informed agency that provides trauma informed care. Trauma informed care requires an organizational framework that involves understanding, recognizing, and responding to the effects of all types of trauma. Trauma informed care also emphasizes physical, psychological, and emotional safety for children, families, staff, and providers, and helps those recovering from trauma build a sense of control and empowerment.</p><p>A. Service Delivery Standards.</p><ol><li>Children and families will receive individualized services matched to their strengths and needs as assessed by the Child and Family Team.<br>(a) Prevention services help resolve family conflicts and behavioral or emotional concerns before there is a need for the family to become deeply involved in the child welfare system.<br>(b) In a family where abuse has already occurred, interventions will be developed with the goal of preventing any future incidents of abuse.</li><li>Services provided to children and families will respect their cultural, ethnic, and religious heritage.</li><li>Services will be provided in the home-based and neighborhood-based settings that are most appropriate for the child or family’s needs.<br>(a) Services will be provided in the least restrictive, most normalized setting appropriate.</li><li>Meaningful child and family participation in decision-making is vitally important, and all children and family members will have a voice (as developmentally appropriate) in influencing decisions made about their lives, to the level of their abilities, even when specialized communication services are required.<br>(a) Children and families will be actively involved in identifying their strengths and needs, and in matching services to identified needs.</li><li>In whatever placement is deemed appropriate siblings should be placed together. When this is not possible or appropriate, siblings should have frequent opportunities to visit each other.</li><li>When an out-of-home placement is required, children should be placed in close proximity to their family with frequent opportunities to visit.</li><li>When children are placed in an environment outside of their parent’s home, they must be provided with educational opportunities and, where developmentally appropriate, vocational opportunities with the goal of becoming self-sufficient adults.</li><li>Children receiving services will receive adequate, timely medical and mental health care that is responsive to their needs.</li></ol><p>B. Standards Relating to Child and Family Teams.</p><ol><li>Working within the context of a Child and Family Team is the most effective way to identify and provide services to children and families.</li><li>Whenever possible, critical decisions about children and families, such as service plan development and modification, removal, placement, and permanency, will be made by a team to include the child and his or her family, the family’s informal helping systems, out-of-home caregivers, and formal supports.</li><li>Child and Family Teams should meet face-to-face periodically to evaluate assessments, case planning, and services delivered, and also to track progress. When there are domestic violence issues, separate Child and Family Team Meetings may be held (refer to Domestic Violence Practice Guidelines <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250421043552/https://public.powerdms.com/UTAHDHS/documents/275062\">Section 600 [<em>sic</em>, broken link]</a>.)</li></ol><p>C. Standards Relating to Assessments.</p><ol><li>Strengths-based assessments should be produced with attention to:<br>(a) The family's underlying needs and conditions.<br>(b) Engaging the family in developing interventions that address the threats of harm, the protective capacities of the family, and the child’s vulnerability.</li></ol><p>D. Standards Relating to Planning.</p><ol><li>Children and/or their family members will be involved in the planning process. The plan will be adapted and changed as the case evolves. The Child and Family Plan:<br>(a) Incorporates input from the family, formal, and informal supports.<br>(h) Identifies family strengths.<br>(b) Utilizes available assessments.<br>(c) Identifies services that address the family’s needs and includes specific steps and services that assist the family in achieving safety, permanency, and the child’s well-being.<br>(e) Anticipates transitions.<br>(f) Addresses safety for both child and adult victims.<br>(g) Identifies permanency goals, including a concurrent permanency goal and plan.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol>\n  </div>"

Serious risk of removal means that there is a high likelihood that the child will be removed from the home if In-Home Services are not provided. A child may be at serious risk of removal based on circumstances and characteristics of the family as a whole and/or circumstances and characteristics of individual parents or children that may affect the parents' ability to safely care for and nurture their children.</p><ol><li>The “home” is where the child is residing during the In-Home Services case.</li><li>The “child” must be a Child Client on the case under 18 years of age and included in the Child and Family Plan.</li><li>Children who are candidates for serious risk of removal may include:<ol><li>Children living in their own home.</li><li>Children living with a non-custodial parent.</li><li>Children who are not in state custody and who are living with a non-licensed relative.</li><li>Children whose adoption or guardianship arrangements are at risk of disruption.</li></ol></li><li>Children who are NOT candidates for serious risk of removal include those children who are in state custody who are:<ol><li>On a trial home placement and are still in state custody.</li><li>Placed in a licensed out-of-home care home whether with a relative or not.</li></ol></li></ol><p>B. Determining serious risk of removal is required at the beginning of the case. A determination of serious risk of removal can be made at any time during the case, but must be re-determined at least every six months.</p><p>C. Serious risk of removal is determined through assessments conducted by caseworkers utilizing designated assessment tools. These assessments determine if the child is at serious risk of removal, but can remain safely in the home or in a kinship placement as long as services that are necessary to prevent the entry of the child into foster care are provided.</p><p>D. Structured Decision Making (SDM) Safety and Risk Assessments are utilized to identify safety and risk factors that put the child at risk of being removed from the home. Safety plans may be used to mitigate threats to the child’s safety allowing the child to remain at home.</p><p>E. The Utah Family and Children Engagement Tool (UFACET) is an assessment completed with the family that identifies the needs that place the child at risk of removal.</p><p>F. The determination that a child is at serious risk of removal will be designated in the Child and Family Plan by incorporating the following language: “This child is at serious risk of removal from home. It is expected that this child will remain safely at home as services in this plan are carried out. If services are not effective, the plan for this child is out-of-home care.”</p><ol><li>If an In-Home Services case is open longer than six months, the results of the updated assessments will re-determine at least every six months if the child continues to be at serious risk of removal. This will captured in the updated Child and Family Plan.</li></ol>\n  </div>"

To be eligible for the Title IV-E Prevention Program, the child must have an open child welfare case and a finalized Child and Family Plan prior to provision of services.</p><p>The following types of child welfare cases apply:</p><ol><li>In-home services, which includes:<br>a. Court-ordered protective supervision cases;<br>b. Voluntary/collaborative cases;<br>c. Post-reunification cases (former foster child at risk of reentry into custody); and<br>d. Kinship services cases (child not in state custody).</li><li>Adoption assistance cases (at risk of disruption).</li><li>Guardianship assistance cases (at risk of disruption).</li></ol><p>Pregnant or parenting foster youth are also eligible for Title IV-E Prevention Program services when services are designated in the child’s foster care plan prior to provision of services.</p><p>Kin caregiver is defined as “relative” in Utah Code Ann. §80-3-102 and includes the child’s grandparent, great grandparent, aunt, great aunt, uncle, great uncle, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepparent, first cousin, stepsibling, sibling of the child, first cousin of the child’s parent, or an adult who is an adoptive parent of the child’s sibling. For the purpose of the Title IV-E Prevention Program, kin caregivers may also include individuals that are unrelated by either birth or marriage, but have an emotionally significant relationship with the child that takes on the characteristics of a family relationship.</p><p>Also, for Indian children, the definition of kin caregiver under ICWA (25 U.S.C. §1903) will be utilized, which includes:</p><ol><li>An \"extended family member\" as defined by the law or custom of the Indian child’s tribe or,</li><li>In the absence of such law or custom, a person who has reached the age of 18 and who is the Indian child’s grandparent, aunt or uncle, brother or sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, niece or nephew, first or second cousin, or stepparent, or</li><li>An Indian custodian, as defined by ICWA case law.</li></ol><p>Children who are under the placement and care responsibility of the state are, by definition, in foster care and are not prevention candidates when placed with a kin caregiver.</p><p><strong>B. Prevention Candidate Determination:</strong> The caseworker determines the child and family eligibility for the Title IV-E Prevention Program through<br>finalization of the Child and Family Plan.</p><p><strong>C. Prevention Plans:</strong> The caseworker will develop an individualized Child and Family Plan based on the needs requiring action identified in UFACET and with input of the Child and Family Team. Evidence-based programming in the areas of substance use, mental health, and parenting skills will be incorporated into the Child and Family Plan. Candidate status is confirmed through finalization of the plan.</p><p><strong>D. Renewal:</strong> A Child and Family Plan will be developed for a new prevention candidate episode at least every 12 months if the child or family still needs prevention services to prevent entry into foster care.</p>\n  </div>"

Racism exists and it cannot be denied</li><li>Agree that racism is unfair, and promise that you will not tolerate such behavior within your sphere of influence. Practice different responses and let him practice his responses too, so that he is prepared to handle racism when it comes up. This is a safety issue; without practice, your child becomes more vulnerable.</li><li>Kids develop new problem-solving skills in middle childhood. When your child says she has been teased or excluded because of race, encourage her to use these skills. Help her to express her feelings and explore short-term and long-term consequences of her possible response. Calmly ask her to say what happened, how she feels, what she did, what else she might have done, and if she has any plans for continued responses. Ask what she would do if it happened again.</li><li>Ask whether you should do anything. Its important for kids to feel capable of handling their own problems-especially as they are learning about being treated unfairly because of race. If possible, help her feel about to handle it without adult protection (particularly from a white adult). That said, it is also critical that children know that their parents are absolutely prepared to take their side and be their ally-if they have something in mind for you to do, be responsive and helpful.&nbsp;</li><li>Elementary school kids are information gatherers. This is an ideal time to provide her with opportunities to gather realistic images and history of her racial heritage. Otherwise, she might be defenseless against stereotyped images of her race and feel bad about herself.</li><li>Your child’s growing ability to categorize and understand increasingly abstract concepts can help her to integrate seemingly contradictory ideas. Help her to learn that all racial groups have both good and bad historical figures, and have made both positive and negative contributions to the world. She will arrive at a deeper understanding of how she can be both Mexican and American or both black and white.</li><li>Make sure that she is able to talk to other people of color who have had similar experiences and can provide new ideas on how to react. Without this exposure the only role models for children adopted transracially will be narrow, generally negative stereotypical characters on television shows and the movies.</li><li>Notice the messages you send in real-life situations: when you walk past a homeless person, when a fundraiser rings your doorbell, or when a person with physical differences serves you. Since none of us is bias- fee, its useful to discuss with our kids the responses that may have been inappropriate or confusing. Soon your child will let you know when your bias is showing.</li><li>If you child resists getting to know other people of color because she has not had enough experience outside of an all-white group to feel comfortable, insist that she participate anyway. She needs to break her isolation to develop skills to cope with racism as much as she needs food and water.</li><li>Demonstrate your acceptance of diversity of all kinds-religious, economic, political, and social-and make fighting racism and other injustice a person matter for you, not just for your child.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><em>From Pact, An Adoption Alliance, 5515 Doyle Street, Suite 1, Emeryville, CA 94608 (510) 243-9460 pactadopt.org Originally published in Adoptive Families Magazine, 2014</em></p><p>Page 140</p>\n  </div>"

Carol Williams, University of North Carolina&nbsp;</p><h4>WHY IS IT DIFFICULT TO DO?&nbsp;</h4><p>Sharing with a child about an unpleasant past is difficult for both workers and parents. The details seem far too painful. Yet, according to Claudia Jewitt, the missing pieces are often those pieces that make sense to the child and fill in the blanks.&nbsp;</p><p>The information is a relief for these children, Jewitt says because it takes the responsibility for what happened off the child. They need to know that they weren’t placed for adoption because of something they did.&nbsp;</p><p>Knowing that it is the right thing to do, and knowing just how to do it are two different things. Just how does a worker or parents carry out this unpleasant task?&nbsp;</p><h4>SHARING ABOUT ABANDONMENT&nbsp;</h4><p>Adults abandon children when life circumstances become overwhelming. One thing a parent can point out, according to Jewitt is to ask the child, Have you ever had a real hard thing to do? Did you get frustrated? What did you want to do? Leave it is generally the answer. The child perhaps can relate to the emotion of frustration.</p><p>Points parents and workers can make:</p><ul><li>People abandoned children out of fear, confusion and frustration</li><li>Children are hard to care for and some people can not handle the responsibility</li><li>A child’s behavior is not the cause of an abandonment</li><li>Adoptive parents will not abandon the child in tough times.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>SHARING ABOUT PHYSICAL ABUSE&nbsp;</h4><p>A child is not slapped, screamed at, or hit because he is a bad child. He is treated that way because the adults in his life are out of control. In helping a child to understand parental angry, Jewitt suggest to ask the child, When you are angry, do you feel like hitting someone? This question will help a child understand in a small way why people hit when they are angry, even though they know it is wrong. Points parents and workers can make:</p><ul><li>When children are hit, the adult is out of control.</li><li>Parents, often frustrated by life circumstances take their anger out on their children, even when they know it is wrong.</li><li>It is possible that their parents experienced the same trauma of abuse growing up an it is the only way they know to handle their anger.</li><li>It is not the child’s fault for what the parent does.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>SHARING ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSE</h4><p>&nbsp;Sexual abuse is a type of abuse that children do feel partially responsible. Perhaps the abuser indicated this to the child. An abuser perhaps told the child he wanted to be close to him in a special way, yet he knew it was wrong. The child often suffers with fear by keeping the secret and guilt after releasing the truth. Both those emotions must be recognized by parents and workers and addressed.</p><p>Points parents and workers can make:</p><ul><li>Sexual abuse is never the fault of the child</li><li>The abuser touched you in ways that were not right and he/she is totally responsible for their actions.</li><li>The child was completely right in disclosing the abuse, even if the remaining parent expressed anger or unbelief.</li><li>The child may have feelings of anger and confusion that he/she should feel safe to express.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>SHARING ABOUT SUBSTANCE ABUSE&nbsp;</h4><p>Children who were placed for adoption may have vivid or vague memories of what life was like living with someone who abuses alcohol or drugs. Children need to have the opportunity to talk about their memories of not having food to eat, not having clean clothes to war or a clean bed to sleep in. Children need to share their fears of the chronically absent, abusive or spaced-out parent.&nbsp;</p><p>Points parents and workers can make:</p><ul><li>You did not cause your parents drinking or drug problem</li><li>Your parent acted like they did toward you because he/she was taking drugs or drinking too much.</li><li>They did not have control over their problem and you needed to be in a safe and secure place to finish growing up.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>SHARING ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS&nbsp;</h4><p>Claudia Jewitt says that children who are placed for adoption because of parents mental illness can be helped to remember or understand behavior that used not consistent with appropriate parenting. Perhaps the child remembers the parent being depressed or observed rapid mood changes making it hard to know what to do.</p><p>Jewitt encourages adoptive parents or workers to help the child make the connection with their life experiences. They may have been afraid of something that other people told them not to be afraid, or they may have had difficulty knowing if they were d reaming or awake.&nbsp;</p><p>Points parents and workers can make:</p><ul><li>Your parent was very upset in his feelings and that kept him/her very confused. They couldn’t make good decisions on how to take care of you.</li><li>It was important that you could finish growing up in a safe home.</li><li>Your parent had this problem before you were born.</li><li>You didn’t cause your parents condition.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>SHARING ABOUT LAWBREAKING&nbsp;</h4><p>Occasionally, children enter into the system, and eventually into foster care and adoption because their parents is incarcerated. Although this knowledge casts a shadow over the child’s perception of his parent, it is important he knows the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>Children need to understand that sometimes parents make bad decisions that have long term consequences. When their parent choose to break the law (and name the offense age appropriately), he/she will suffer long term consequences.&nbsp;</p><p>Points parents and workers can make:</p><ul><li>Your parent chose to break the law because he/she thought it would help him/her solve her problems. It did not.</li><li>Your parents decision resulted in their being sent to jail for a long time.</li><li>Because they will be in jail for a long time, the court decided that it would be too long a time for you to be without a family.</li></ul><p>Whatever the situation regarding a child’s history, the truth is paramount. One adult adoptee, in learning of the criminal past of her parents said. It is not a pretty truth, but at least it is the truth. Now I can go on with my life without the make-believe.</p><p>Page 122</p>\n  </div>"

Remember to be sensitive to anniversary reactions and increased emotional stress around birthdays, holidays, and Mothers Day. Be sure to discuss feelings and fears openly.</li><li>Allow the adoptive father to become the primary parent during adolescence. Much of the child’s grief anger regarding abandonment and divided loyalties are directed toward the birth mother. This anger is often transferred to the adoptive mother. The mother/ teen relationship can become very strained. The adoptive father should handle limit setting whenever possible.</li><li>Avoid control battles.

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>Children who have suffered a loss through death, divorce, foster care, adoption, or other separations seem to share several common issues. However, each child will react or respond to the loss dependent upon:</p><ul><li>The significance of the loss</li><li>Whether the loss is temporary or permanent</li><li>Inherent coping abilities of the child</li><li>Availability of supports</li><li>Age and cognitive abilities of the child</li><li>At the time of loss</li><li>At the present time&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Consequently, while some children may react in very extreme ways, others may respond mildly or not at all. In addition, while one child may be affected in the area of loyalty, for example, another may be preoccupied with identity issues. What follows is a discussion of these common themes with particular attention to their appearance in adoption.&nbsp;</p><h4>GRIEF&nbsp;</h4><p>When children have been separated from significant figures, their emotional response is one of grief and mourning. For the child adopted as an infant, the loss is of the fantasy or dream parent they have never met and of what might have been. For the child adopted at an older age, it most likely is a real loss of biological family or foster family. Grief is a process. There are five identifiable stages. However, not every individual will experience each stage or experience them in the order presented:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SHOCK/DENIAL: </strong>The child is emotionally numb and cannot accept the loss. The child may deny his/her own past or ethnicity. The child denies that s/ he is adopted or may refuse to talk about being adopted. This stage is the minds attempt to prevent the individual from feeling the pain of loss.</p><p><strong>ANGER/RAGE:</strong> Now the numbness has worn off. Unfortunately, for the adopted child/youth, this stage frequently coincides with adolescence, creating great chaos and confusion. Youth may be angry at themselves for causing the separation, thus feeling guilty, and many punish themselves via self-defeating behaviors. The youth may be angry with the adoptive parents, perceiving the adoption as a kidnapping and may be verbally abusive, defiant, physically aggressive, truant, irritable, or oppositional. And the teen may be angry at the birth family for abandoning him/her.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BARGAINING:</strong> In this stage, youth attempt to regain the lost figure through manipulation. The sophistication of the bargaining behaviors is dependent as good as gold thinking that they’ll be rewarded for their behavior. Older Adolescents may run away, make allegations of abuse, or try to negotiate the return of the lost figure. Children in this stage of grief also spend a great deal of time fantasizing about the birth family, often looking for them in favorite teachers, movie stars, or even in crowds.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DEPRESSION:</strong> Once the youth recognizes that the attachment figure is not returning, s/he will enter into depression, a state of mourning and sadness. Here, the youth withdraws from normal activities; eating and sleeping patterns change. S/he is moody and cries easily. Suicidal ideations and gestures as well as substance abuse may also appear as problems for some youth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RESOLUTION/UNDERSTANDING:</strong> Under normal circumstances, one cannot tolerate lengthy periods of psychic pain or depression. Consequently, the youth will begin to move towards resolution, slowly at first. It should be noted though, that grief is never fully resolved. Given time and support, it does become manageable. Occasions will arise such as holidays, anniversaries, or other significant events during which the youth may re-grieve their loss. When a child enters resolution, there is a return to age-appropriate activities and developmental tasks. Life is fun again. School performance and appearance improve. The child re-engages in the family.</p><h4>CONTROL&nbsp;</h4><p>For children who have experienced a loss, many feel that they have had no control or decision-making power over their own lives. The adopted child/ youth did not choose to lose his/her birth family. This generates a feeling of frustration and helplessness for many children. Consequently, they may try to regain control of their lives by being orderly, compulsive, neat-needing routine or planning ahead. Other youth may demonstrate their need for control via constant power struggles with authority figures, truancy, defiance, substance abuse, or tantrums. The bright, sophisticated child may hide things, hoard food, develop eating disorders, or utilize more creative means to control family life. In fact, some adopted children create chaos in the family as a means of controlling other family members.&nbsp;</p><h4>LOYALTY&nbsp;</h4><p>Having at least two sets of parents creates quite a conflict for the child (whether the parents are real or fantasy). This is also frequently the case for children of divorce. The child may feel that closeness and love for one set of parents may be an act of disloyalty towards the other set of parents, thus hurting them. The child finds himself/herself in a dilemma and may be overwhelmed by feelings of guilt. Behaviors frequently seen are: distancing from family members, fantasizing about birth family, confusion/conflict regarding search, guilt over being happy in the adoptive family, denial of having questions or curiosity regarding their adoption. The issue of divided loyalty frequently crops up around the time of the child’s birthday or around Mothers Day.&nbsp;</p><h4>REJECTION/FEAR OF ABANDONMENT&nbsp;</h4><p>Regardless of the actual circumstances surrounding the child’s adoption, the child’s perception is frequently one that s/he was rejected and subsequently abandoned by the birth family. Consequently, some adopted children/youth may feel hurt or angry toward their birth parents. Some adopted children feel that they are unlovable and unkeepable, and they may act out to test the commitment of the adoptive family. To avoid rejection, some adopted persons may not allow themselves to get close to others, or they will reject others before they can be rejected. Some adopted persons react by continually seeking acceptance and approval from those around them, being almost too good. It is not surprising that developing and maintaining relationships is a difficult task for some.&nbsp;</p><h4>SELF-ESTEEM&nbsp;</h4><p>The perception of being rejected is a direct blow to the adopted child’s self-esteem. As one adopted youth said, How can someone who never knew me give me away? Some adopted persons believe that something is wrong with them. They may feel unwanted. Some adopted individuals assume the worst about their birth families and believe that their genetic make-up is flawed. School performance and self-confidence are frequently affected. Because they believe themselves to be less, they may settle for less-thanideal friends, or act out their negative self-image. They may engage in self-endangering behaviors. Some adopted youth seem to fear success which would challenge their negative self-concept.&nbsp;</p><h4>TRUST&nbsp;</h4><p>This is a particularly crucial issue for children who have had multiple moves during their young lives. Separations at an early age may threaten the establishment of a basic trust and attachment critical for healthy growth and development. Many older adopted children have a history of abuse and neglect, and homes where broken promises are the norm. These children may avoid closeness, or may require longer times to warm up. They may have difficulty with intimacy or become involved in clinging, dependent relationships. Stealing, lying, and delayed conscience development may occur in some cases.</p><h4>IDENTITY&nbsp;</h4><p>The lack of information and secrecy that frequently surround the child’s history and birth family make it difficult for the adopted youth to establish his/her identity, a major task of adolescent development. The teen may find this issue confusing, frustrating, and scary. They may have no known history or connection to formulate a base for the self. “Who am I?” is no longer a rhetorical question. For the child adopted at an older age, the information may be negative (mental illness, substance abuse, abuse/ neglect) or chaotic.&nbsp;</p><p>Adolescent who are experiencing extreme difficulty may run away, try out multiple (and usually bizarre) identities, hang out with less-than-ideal peers, engage in promiscuity, or develop pregnancy, depression, or extreme anger. Some adopted persons state that they have always felt different and have never fit in with their peers, as being adopted prevented them from being like everyone else. Consequently, they may initiate a search to satisfy this need, or they may create a blood tie though pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><p>Not all adopted youth experience problems with these issues. Some may experience minor difficulties at different developmental stages. These minor difficulties may be handled successfully by the adoptive family, sometimes with the help of a knowledgeable professional. A small percentage of adopted youth find these issues overwhelming and require more intensive services. It is recommended that adoptive families experiencing extreme distress find post adoptive services that can provide support and assistance that is specific to the adoption-related issues of the child.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Developed by Denise Goodman, PhD and Betsy Keefer, LSW</em></p><p>Page 107</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>While rewards may be realistic expectations of foster care or adoption, some prospective parents are not prepared for the time and energy that may be expended before those rewards are enjoyed. Many prospective caregivers may have unrealistic expectations about their foster care or adoption experiences. Some of the unrealistic expectations held by disappointed foster and adoptive parents include the following:</p><ul><li>Our love will be enough. Some parents believe that they can erase years of maltreatment and mistrust by providing a child with love and stability. While nurturance and permanence do promote healing, improvement occurs over a long period of time.</li><li>We will feel love and connection to this child quickly. Attachment develops over time, and many children protect themselves from rejection by refusing to allow themselves the vulnerability of attachment. When child are slow to connect emotionally, it is only human to anticipate other family members will likewise need time to develop attachment to the child.</li><li>This child will step into our family system and easily learn how to function within our rules, goals, and ambitions. Of course the child will be asked to make significant adjustments to a new family, but the foster and adoptive family will also be required to make significant adjustments as well. Those families who recognize the areas in which flexibility will be essential (e.g. scheduling, behavior management, diversity impacting life style and values) will be much more successful.&nbsp;</li><li>This child’s needs will be just like those of our biological children. When children have experienced the traumas of child maltreatment as well as separation, of course they will have experiences that impact their feelings and behaviors. The parenting strategies that proved successful with children who have always been in stable, nurturing homes may not be effective with traumatized children. New skills and strategies, empathy, patience, and flexibility will be required of foster and adoptive parents.</li><li>Our biological children will embrace this new child as a sibling. Whenever a new child joins the family, whether by birth, foster care, or adoption, the existing children in the home will be affected by the changing family system. The permanent children in the family may be initially excited about the prospect of having a foster or adopted sibling, but feel very differently after the child arrives.</li><li>Our child will fit into well into our extended family and be welcomed by them. Sometimes the extended family does not have the same commitment to the foster care or adoption plan of the caregiving family. If problems surface after the placement, the extended family may withdraw support. This can lead to disappointment and strained family relationships.</li><li>Our friends and acquaintances will validate our role as parent in the child’s life. Like the extended family, some friends may withdraw support from the foster or adoptive family, leading to feelings of isolation. The friends may even question why the foster family should have to deal with challenges: why don’t you just send him back? You’re not the real parent anyway.</li><li>Our child will forget about his birth family and his past. Moving into a new family does not erase a child’s past attachments. Even if the child has not memory of the birth family, the birth parents are psychologically present for the child.</li><li>We can do for this child what was not done for us, or we will not do to this child what was done to us. Parenting a traumatized child can trigger a parents own painful memories of victimization or abandonment. Sometimes a prospective foster and adoptive parent is motivated to rescue a child from a difficult family situation that is possibly very similar to his or her own. Providing a safe haven for a traumatized child can release long-buried feelings from a parents own past.</li><li>We will never feel any second thoughts or ambivalence about providing a foster or adoptive home for a child with a traumatic past. It is not uncommon for children to test the stamina and commitment of their substitute caregiver, and it is only human to anticipate this testing will lead to moments of doubt or ambivalence about the decision to foster or adopt. These feelings are normal and should be expected.</li></ul><p>Page 95</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p><strong>MYTH: </strong>Primary parents who abuse, neglect, or relinquish their children do not care about them.</p><p><strong>REALITY: </strong>Primary parents do not plan to abuse or neglect children. Maltreatment of children usually occurs following overwhelming stress. Parents who maltreat their children may, in fact, love their children dearly, but may not be able to cope with circumstances or may not know how to parent successfully. Furthermore, parents who voluntarily relinquish their children usually do so with tremendous ambivalence; they do not walk away from these relationships without significant, lifelong grief.</p><p><strong>MYTH: </strong>Most primary parents are violent, dangerous people who pose a threat to the foster families caring for their children.</p><p><strong>REALITY: </strong>Some primary parents have a history of violence or mental health problems that indicate risk for caregivers. Most primary parents, however, can build a collaborative relationship with foster or kinship parents that can be invaluable in the rapid reunification of the family. When the caseworker or foster parent is unsure about the level of risk posed by a primary family, relationships should be built with deliberate care along a continuum of openness, with the safety of the foster caregivers of paramount concern.</p><p><strong>MYTH: </strong>Foster families are expected to function as caseworkers or therapists for primary families.</p><p><strong>REALITY: </strong>Foster families may serve in key roles as mentors with primary families. When foster and primary families develop a partnership, this will be part of a total intervention plan developed by the child welfare team. The intervention planning will involve the foster parent and will spell out the expectations for the foster parents, when those interventions will occur, and why they are planned to improve the outcomes for the child.</p><p><strong>MYTH: </strong>The agency is setting up foster families to be hurt by dangerous primary parents.</p><p><strong>REALITY: </strong>The agency will not expect foster families to place themselves at risk in working with primary families. The agency will always consider risks when developing a partnering plan for primary and foster families, and foster families will be involved in the development of the plan. Communication between foster and primary families may, at times, need to occur through an agency intermediary, usually the caseworker, to protect the safety of the child and the foster family.</p><p><strong>MYTH: </strong>Foster families are expected to work with all primary families of children who come into foster care.</p><p><strong>REALITY: </strong>Foster families are expected to communicate with the primary parents of all children. That communication may take many forms, depending on the characteristics of the primary family, the wishes of the foster family, and the stage of the developing relationship between the foster and primary families. Relationships may begin with a journal of the child’s progress, move into telephone calls between the primary and foster parents, meetings during supervised visits at the agency, and eventually evolve into unsupervised visits at the foster or primary home prior to reunification.</p><p><strong>MYTH: </strong>Foster parent will be responsible for caring for the primary parents as well as the child.</p><p><strong>REALITY: </strong>The role of the foster parent is to provide a safe, temporary home for children who are unable to remain in their primary homes. Foster parents are part of a team whose primary goal is reunification. Visitation and communication are essential to achieving that goal. However, caring for the primary parent is not an expectation of the foster parent; it would actually be counterproductive to the development of adult, responsible behavior by the primary parent.</p><p>Page 80</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>Because of the trauma children in care have experienced, and the often ineffective coping skills they have learned. Caregivers and adoptive parents may find themselves dealing with a child who is experiencing an emotional crisis. These children are flooded with emotions they have not learned to deal with, and respond reflexively with behaviors they have not yet learned to control.&nbsp;</p><p>In general, there are three steps to addressing a crisis: establish safety, communicate with the caseworker, and document the crisis.&nbsp;</p><h4>ESTABLISH SAFETY&nbsp;</h4><p>Protect other children in the home. Children not involved in the conflict should be removed from the scene of the conflict and sent to their rooms. Removing an audience can be an effective tool in de-escalating a family crisis. Any objects nearby which could be harmful to the child or others in the family (knives or other sharp objects, objects that could become missiles) should be removed from the proximity of the child in crisis. Many foster caregiver and adoptive parents choose to store family heirlooms and treasured possessions before a child arrives rather than risk they be damaged during a crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>Foster caregivers or adoptive parents may decide to go to their rooms. This removes an audience for the child’s or youths tantrum and, at the same time, removes the adult from a potentially dangerous confrontations. Removing the adult from the conflict will sometimes keep a crisis from escalating beyond a manageable level.&nbsp;</p><p>The caregiver or adoptive parent interacting with the child should be an emotional container (NCTSN, 2010). This term refers to the ability of the caregiver to tolerate their own emotional reactions and control their behavior, including body language, tone of voice, and phrasing. Being an emotional container is not an easy thing, and additional training and lots of practice is needed.&nbsp;</p><p>If the child is engaging in dangerous behavior, the caregiver or adoptive parent may need to ask for help from another adult, or in an emergency, from the police.&nbsp;</p><h4>COMMUNICATE WITH THE CASEWORKER&nbsp;</h4><p>Caregivers and adoptive parents should talk with their worker ahead of time to find out who should be contacted if the caseworker is unable to be reached or it is not during her work hours and other agency-specific protocol. Caregivers and adoptive parents should contact the caseworker as soon as they are able after they have established safety during the crisis, and report what has happened. Always de-brief following a crisis so that the opportunity to learn more about successful strategies is not lost.&nbsp;</p><p>Develop plans with the child and the caseworker or therapist for avoiding or resolving similar problems in the future. Consider what triggered the child and how the trigger can be avoided in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Advocate for additional support for the child in learning to manage emotions and behaviors. The caregiver or adoptive parent should ask the worker what additional supports there are for them and where they can get additional crisis prevention/management training.&nbsp;</p><h4>DOCUMENT THE CRISIS&nbsp;</h4><p>Caregivers and adoptive parents should document the incident as soon as possible while the details are fresh in their memory. If other children or adults witnessed the incident, they should be asked to describe or document what they saw. A copy of the documentation should be sent to the caseworker as soon as possible and caregivers and adoptive parents should keep a copy for themselves. The therapist, if one is involved, should also receive a copy.</p><p>Page 69</p>\n  </div>"

DCFS role in Qualitative Case Reviews (QCRs):</p><ol><li>QCRs:<ol><li>Measure the child and family status as well as system performance as they relate to services delivered to children and families served by DCFS.</li><li>Is not a review of casework compliance with federal, state, or other procedures or regulations.</li><li>Focus is on casework “best practices.”</li><li>Rely on face-to-face interviews with members of the child and family team (including the family) that provide support to the child and family.</li></ol></li><li>DCFS region responsibilities:<ol><li>If the child is not in DCFS’ custody, regions will obtain the consent of the parent/guardian of the child designated as the target child for the review to participate in the review.</li><li>Regions will schedule interviews with clients, providers, and others participating in the review.</li><li>Regions will ensure that the primary caseworker assigned to a case under review will attend both an initial interview and an exit interview with reviewers. If the caseworker is not able to attend these interviews, the supervisor or other region administrator will attend.</li><li>Regions will help ensure that the review runs smoothly by providing reviewers with information and office accommodations.</li></ol></li></ol><p>B. DCFS Role in Case Process Reviews (CPRs):</p><ol><li>CPRs:<ol><li>Review case documentation to evaluate caseworker compliance with DCFS Guidelines, principles that identify minimal service delivery standards in the areas of CPS, In-Home Services, and Out-of-Home Care Services.</li><li>Identify whether a service delivery activity was completed but do not evaluate the quality or effectiveness of an activity.</li></ol></li><li>Region responsibilities:<ol><li>Regions will provide any documentation that might allow reviewers to appropriately score questions.</li><li>Whenever possible, regions will assist reviewers by having the caseworker associated with a case attend a meeting following the review.<ol><li>If this is not possible, the region will have either the supervisor or a region administrator attend the meeting.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p>C. DCFS role in trend data analysis:</p><ol><li>Trend data analysis:<ol><li>Formally reviews data elements that evaluate service delivery to children and families in the broader view of protection, permanence, and well-being, and ultimately identifies trends in data that show progress in the areas of CPS, In-Home Services, and Out-of-Home Services and treatment.</li><li>Three separate committees review trend data on a quarterly basis and watch for significant changes in data indicators.

Minutes will include:<ol><li>Data discussed.</li><li>Trends identified.</li><li>Recommendations the committee feels will influence trends and thus improve both data collection and outcomes for children and families served.</li></ol></li><li>The state administrative team will review the following quarter‘s minutes from the trends and QIC meetings and will determine any actions to be taken based on the recommendations provided by those committees.</li><li>The state administrative team will report back to committees during the quarter following the one in which the recommendations were made. Reports will include:<ol><li>Steps taken by the state administrative team to address recommendations.</li><li>Outlines of state and region action plans formulated in response to the recommendations.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p>D. Changes and modifications to review tools or the review process.</p><ol><li>Significant modifications to review tools or the review process may be made by DCFS in order to comply with or implement changes in the law. The CWIC will receive written notice to include:<br>a. The proposed change.<br>b. A summary of the reason for the change.<br>c. The proposed date of the implementation of the change.</li><li>The CWIC will have no fewer than 45 days to comment on the proposed change (the proposed date for change must be at least 45 days after the notice is given).</li><li>DCFS will give full, fair, and good faith consideration to all comments and objections received, and will notify the CWIC in writing of their decisions regarding the CWIC’s comments and reasons supporting their decision.</li><li>DCFS will provide information on all material changes in its annual report.</li><li>To assure that review findings are objective and maintain high inter-rater reliability, the content of questions within review tools may be modified.<ol><li>Modifications may include collapsing or combining questions as long as another question will evaluate the same issue and deliver similar data.</li><li>The frequency of reviews may be modified.<ol><li>Modifications will not provide for less than annual reviews, eliminate reviews, or change the major focus of the review without the consent of groups (listed in B.2.) that review trend data.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p>E. Supervisor Finishing Touches (SFT):</p><ol><li>Is not a formal review but is an administrative tool used by supervisors and regional administrators to evaluate the effectiveness of services provided by a caseworker and formulate recommendations that may help a caseworker better meet the needs of their clients.</li><li>Required responsibilities of supervisors.<ol><li>Supervisors will perform one SFT review per caseworker per month.</li><li>Supervisors will ensure results of reviews are entered in SAFE.</li></ol></li></ol>\n  </div>"

Written approval may be in the form of a letter signed by the caseworker or by email.

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>A. Foster Care Provider Over Payments. If a review of payment records by DCFS staff (including regional or state administration, supervisors, or financial managers) determines that a payment made by DCFS to an out-of-home care provider was incorrectly over paid, DCFS may require the over payment amount to be repaid. Repayment of the overpaid amount will be sought when the amount exceeds $10.00. The incorrect payment information will be provided to the regional Administrative Services<br>Manager (ASM), who along with the caseworker will examine the information that caused the over payment and, when necessary, will correct the information in SAFE or in the payment data to accurately reflect the number of units and the dollar amount the provider should be paid. The ASM will take the following actions to recover the payment overage:</p><ol><li>The ASM or a designated regional staff member will provide written notice to the provider of the over payment and request the provider to repay the overage within 30 days of the date of the written notice.</li><li>If the provider believes the DHHS/DCFS’ determination is incorrect, the provider will have 14 days from the date of the written notice to appeal the payment notice by providing information in writing to the ASM that supports the accuracy of the payment. The ASM will provide the over payment information and the appeal to the region director or designee to make a determination as to whether the over payment occurred.</li><li>If, after a review of the provider’s appeal, DCFS verifies the over payment occurred, the provider will remit the full repayment within 30 days of the determination.</li><li>If the provider is unable to remit the full repayment of the over payment amount within 30 days, DCFS will work with the provider to make payment arrangements. Failure to repay the over payment amount or failure to comply with the arrangement for repayment may result in DCFS suspending current and/or future placements with the provider, even if the provider maintains a current license. DCFS also reserves the right to seek collection of the over payment amount through the Office of Recovery Services (ORS) and/or other collection agencies. If a collection agency is used to recoup the over payment amount, the provider may also be responsible to pay for any attorney fees, collection fees, or other fees required by a collection agency.</li></ol><p>B. Foster Care Provider Under Payments. If a review of payment records by DCFS staff (including regional or state administration, supervisors, or financial managers) determines that a payment made by DCFS to an out-of-home care provider was not sufficient or was under paid for services rendered, DCFS will initiate a payment to the provider for the shortage. The information will be provided to the regional ASM, who along with the caseworker will verify the information that caused the shortage and will correct the information in SAFE or in the payment data to accurately reflect the number of units and the dollar amount the provider should be paid. The ASM will then remit the payment to the provider.</p><ol><li>If a provider determines that they have been under paid, they are responsible to contact the DCFS regional office that initiated the payment so that the under payment can be investigated.</li><li>If the provider is dissatisfied with the outcome of the regional office investigation, they may submit a written request to the regional ASM within 30 days of the payment disparity (under payment) for formal review by the region director or designee.</li></ol>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <h4>FOSTER CAREGIVER PARTICIPATION IN COURT</h4><p>The federal law Adoption &amp; Safe Families Act (ASFA) was passed in 1997 and gives foster and kinship caregivers, as well as pre-adoptive parents, the right to be heard in certain court hearings about the child in their care. Juvenile courts must give notice to foster caregivers in any review or hearing with respect to the child. In other words, the child’s current foster caregivers must be given the opportunity to give the child’s judge information they believe will be helpful in decision-making about the child’s best interests. The federal law also mandates that foster caregivers have input into 6-month case reviews and permanency hearings.</p><p>While foster caregivers have a right to be informed of court hearings and have an opportunity to be heard, they are not entitled to be made parties to the case. Parties are those people designated by the law or the court to participate fully in the court hearings. Parties have rights that non-parties do not. Parties in child welfare cases normally include birth parents, the child welfare agency, and the child.

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p><strong>ABANDONMENT: </strong>Leaving a child without care by either parent or guardian and showing a conscious disregard for parental obligations leading to the destruction of the parent/child relationship, such as leaving a child in the care of another adult and neither parent demonstrating intent to resume physical custody or make arrangements for ongoing care. No effort to communicate with the child is made.</p><p><strong>ABUSE: </strong>Actual or threatened non-accidental physical or mental harm, negligent treatment, sexual exploitation, or any sexual abuse.</p><p><strong>ADJUDICATION: </strong>The initial phase of the court proceeding, wherein the court must find by clear and convincing evidence, that the child is an abused, neglected, or dependent child. Only if the court so finds, does it have the power to change custody or to order the parents to participate in services.</p><p><strong>ADOPTION: </strong>The creations of parental rights and responsibilities by the juvenile or district court after the termination of all rights and responsibilities of the birth parents or any other person holding legal rights to the child. Children become available for adoption in the United States through one of two routes: Parental rights are terminated by the court due to abuse, neglect or dependency, and permanent custody is given to the division who is then responsible to find a permanent family for the child; or the individual holding custody of a child offers to sign a permanent surrender to an agency without adversarial proceedings.</p><p><strong>ADOPTIVE SEARCH: </strong>A process by which adoptees, adoptive parents, or birth parents secure information about each other and the circumstances surrounding the adoptive process. While some adoptees search for information about birth parents, searches for siblings often motivate the individual to find out more about their early histories. By Utah law, the Department of Health, Division of Health Care Resources, Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics maintains an adoptive registry where birth parents and legal aged adoptees may register when they wish to be reconciled.</p><p><strong>ADOPTION SUBSIDY: </strong>Financial support to adoptive parents of a child whose needs or conditions have created barriers which would prevent successful adoption. The subsidy may include state medical assistance, reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses, a monthly financial subsidy, and/or supplemental adoption assistance.</p><p><strong>APPEAL: </strong>The legal process by which a party who has lost his case at trial level petitions a higher court for a review of the case, claiming that a lower court erred in its judgment. Following a decision by the court to terminate parental rights, the parent has thirty days to file an appeal with the Utah Court of Appeals, requesting a reversal of the lower court’s decision. Children placed with an adoptive family during the appeal process are said to be in a legal risk placement. This implies that the child could be returned to the birth family based on the court’s decision.</p><p><strong>CASA: </strong>Court Appointed Special Advocates, are volunteer child advocates appointed by the court. The CASA is responsible for presenting the court with reports and recommendations concerning the course of action she believes to be in the best interest of the child.</p><p><strong>CULTURE: </strong>Culture refers to a system of values, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and standards of behavior that govern the organization of people into social groups and regulate both group and individual behavior. Culture is created by groups of individuals to assure the survival and well-being of group members. Culture is learned and is more complex than either ethnicity or race.</p><p><strong>CUSTODY</strong>: A relationship established through the courts granting custody, protective custody, or temporary custody which provides the following rights and duties:</p><p>[UCA 78-3A-103 (1) (N)]:</p><ul><li>The right to physical custody of a child;</li><li>The right and duty to protect, train and discipline a child</li><li>The duty to provide the child with food, clothing, shelter, education and ordinary medical care.</li><li>The right to determine where and with whom the child shall live; and</li><li>The right, in an emergency, to authorize surgery of other extraordinary care.</li></ul><p><strong>DEPENDENCY: </strong>The condition of a child who is homeless or without proper care through no fault of the child’s parent or guardian [UCA 62A-4a-101(7)]. Dependency may be due to a lack of education or understanding by the child’s parent or guardian or due to a mental, emotional or physical disability. Dependency may also be due to a parent or guardians lack of economic resources or the institutionalization or incarceration of a parent or guardian. Dependency may be a legal finding of the Juvenile Court.</p><p><strong>DISPOSITION: </strong>The second phase of the court proceedings which follows the adjudication and which focuses on the issue of custody and the best interest of the child.</p><p><strong>FAILURE TO THRIVE: </strong>A serious medical condition usually seen in children less than one year of age. The child’s height, weight, and motor development fall significantly short of the average growth rates or normally developing children. In the majority of cases, no medical cause can be found in children with this syndrome. The syndrome appears to be caused by a disturbed parent/child relationship which results in the parent being unable to meet her child emotional and physical needs including, most often, is failing to feed the infant.</p><p><strong>FINALIZATION: </strong>Court hearing at which the Juvenile or District Court terminates custody by the agency and awards full custody, including all rights and responsibilities, to the adoptive family. Utah law requires that a child be in the adoptive home a minimum of six months [UCA 78-30-24.7] before the child can be legally adopted.</p><p><strong>GUARDIAN AD LITEM (GAL)</strong>: A special guardian appointed by the court to represent the best interest of the child. In some counties a GAL may be either an attorney or a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA). A GAL must be appointed to every case alleging abuse, neglect, or dependency. The agency shall inform foster care providers of the name, address, and phone number of the GAL for each child placed.</p><p><strong>GUARDIANSHIP: </strong>The authority to consent to marriage, to enlistment in the armed forces, to major medical, surgical, or psychiatric treatment, and to legal custody, if legal custody is not vested in another person, agency, or institution [UCA 78-3a-103(1)(m).</p><p><strong>HOME STUDY: </strong>The process of assessing a family for the purpose of adoption, foster care or kinship care. The process generally involves at least three contacts between the family and the licensor, an on-site visit to the family home and interviews with all the family members including the children. The finished product is written document that may be presented to the agency, the court and other parties to approve or deny the applicants the ability to foster or adopt a child.</p><p><strong>INDEPENDENT LIVING: </strong>Basic life skills services and supervised living for youth age 16 or older in the custody of the agency to prepare for the transition from state custody to independence. Youth must be attending school or working full or part-time to be eligible. Basic life skill training includes community resources; job search; employment maintenance; money management; housing and food purchasing and preparations. Youth who are actually living in an independent setting may receive the basic out-ofhome care maintenance payment to assist with expenses.</p><p><strong>KINSHIP CARE: </strong>Out-of-home care which is provided to children by relatives, members of their tribes or clans, godparents, step-parents or to whomever a child, child’s parents and family members ascribe a family relationship. Preferential consideration shall be given to a relatives request for placement of a child [UCA 78-3a-307] if this is in the best interest of the child and if the relatives are approved or licensed as foster parents.</p><p><strong>LEGAL RISK PLACEMENT: </strong>Legal risk is the placement of a child who is not yet legally free for adoption with adoptive parents who are also licensed as foster parents. The adoptive home and the placement of the child must be approved by the regional adoption committee. The child’s legal availability for adoption cannot be guaranteed to the prospective adoptive family. Prospective adoptive parents have the right to be informed of this circumstance prior to placement of the child in their home.</p><p><strong>LIFE BOOK: </strong>A scrapbook, diary, or log kept for or by the child which recreated the child’s personal history including birth, placements, important persons in his life, personal achievements and information about the child’s experiences in foster care and adoption.</p><p><strong>MINIMUM COMMUNITY STANDARDS: </strong>Community standards are developed by the juvenile court and the local DCFS agency with input from the other community sources. These state the minimum level of acceptable child care practices in that particular community. The standards should take into account cultural norms and practices as well as accurate information about child development. The standards are used to make decisions about what constitutes sufficient risk to warrant CPS (Child Protective Services) involvement. Standards may also affect placement decisions. This is not the same standards as the best interest of the child.</p><p><strong>NEGLECT: </strong>Generally defined as abandonment of a child or subjecting a child to mistreatment of abuse or lack of proper parental care by reason of the fault or habits of the parent or guardian to provide proper parental care or necessary sustenance, education, or medical care, including surgery or psychiatric services when required or any other care necessary for the child’s health, safety, morals or well-being. A child may be at risk of being neglected or abused because another child in the same home is neglected or abused.</p><p><strong>OPEN ADOPTION: </strong>The practice of providing information between a child’s birth parents, adoptive parents and or the child as the child matures. Most adoptions in the United States have some degree of openness, from very little written information to full disclosure and face to face contact before, during and after the adoption is finalized. Open adoption is a voluntary agreement that cannot be enforced after the adoption is finalized.</p><p><strong>PARTIES: </strong>Those persons who are deemed necessary by law to be participants in a court action. In a dependency, neglect, and/or abuse case, the parties include the child, legal parents or guardians, and any other individual who appears to the court to be proper or necessary to the court proceeding. All parties are entitled to legal representation at all stages of the proceedings, and if indigent, are entitled to a court-appointed attorney.</p><p><strong>PEER PARENTS: </strong>Foster parents who are trained and paid to serve as mentors and role models to parents. Skills which peer parents may teach are cooking, cleaning, and managing a household; shopping economically and budgeting; physically caring for infants or young children/ effective discipline; playing with children; nurturing behaviors; behavior management strategies; accessing community resources; social skills; effective communication; and problem solving.</p><p><strong>PERMANENT CUSTODY &amp; GUARDIANSHIP: </strong>A legal status created by the court, and granted to a county child protection agency following the termination of all parental rights, privileges, and obligations from the birth or custodial family or guardian. This gives the agency full authority and responsibility to provide a permanent, safe, and nurturing family for the child.</p><p><strong>POST ADOPTION SERVICES: </strong>Services offered to an adoptive family following finalization of the adoptive placement. Many adoptive families of children with special needs require continued support and services from the agency. These services shall be focused on matters related to the adoption and pre-existing conditions of the child. Services may include respite care, out-of-home care, parenting classes, adoptive parent support groups, and information and referral. These services may be accessible through the use of subsidy payments.</p><p><strong>PRE-PLACEMENT VISITS: </strong>In either foster care or adoption, a series of visits are made by the child to the prospective home to prepare the child for the eventual move and lessen the trauma to the child. In all adoptive placements and when possible in foster care, there should be a series of visits designed to familiarized the child with the home, family and surrounding community. The younger the child, the more frequent the visits and the quicker the move; the older the child, the slower and longer the pace of the visits. However, the pace and frequency vary from case to case and must take into consideration the child’s needs and developmental level.</p><p><strong>PRE-TRIAL: </strong>An informal hearing which is scheduled as soon as possible after the shelter hearing. All the parties involved in court action discuss the case in an effort to agree on issues of adjudication (whether the case is dependency, neglect, or abuse) and the disposition (custody, service plan contents, visitation, criminal prosecution, etc.) In some instances the case is settled at this point and court involvement may end.</p><p><strong>PRIMARY FAMILY: </strong>The persons with whom the child welfare system is working to reunify a child. This may include birth parents, extended family members, or others with whom the child has strong prior attachments. The child’s family should help determine who is included in their family and the child welfare system should respect this determination.</p><p><strong>PROTECTIVE CUSTODY: </strong>The shelter of a child by the agency from the time the child is removed from his home until the shelter hearing or the child’s return home whichever occurs earlier [UCA 62A-4a-101(5) AND 78-3A103(2)(b)].</p><p><strong>RESIDUAL PARENTAL RIGHTS: </strong>Those rights and duties remaining with the parent after legal custody or guardianship, or both, have been vested in another person or agency, including the responsibility for support, the right to consent to adoption, the right to determine the child’s religious affiliation, and the right to reasonable visitation unless restricted by the court. If no guardian has been appointed, residual parental rights and duties also include the right to consent to marriage, to enlistment, and to major medical, surgical, or psychiatric treatment [UCA 78-3a-103(u)].</p><p><strong>SERVICE OR CHILD AND FAMILY PLAN: </strong>A written plan between the agency and the parents which outlines roles, responsibilities, and activities to be completed within a limited time period. A plan shall be developed for each child in foster care within 45 days after a child’s removal from his home or placement in DCFS custody and shall include a permanency goal for the child (return home, adoption, custody/guardianship, or independent living). An interdisciplinary team (Child and Family Team) shall be used to develop each plan including the birth parents, foster parents, caseworker, supervisor, guardian ad litem, and mental health and education representatives. All parties to the plan, including foster parents, shall sign and be given a copy.</p><p><strong>SEXUAL ABUSE: </strong>Acts or attempted acts of sexual intercourse, sodomy or molestation directed towards a child [UCA 62A-4a-402(7)], which may include digital or object penetration in the vagina or anus, touching the anus, buttocks or any part of the genitals, touching the breast of a female, or otherwise taking indecent liberties with intent to cause substantial emotional or bodily pain to any person or with the intent to cause substantial emotional or bodily pain to any person with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person. A child under the age of 14 cannot legally consent to any sexual act. A child under the age of 16 cannot legally consent to sexual intercourse: a child under the age of 18 cannot consent to sexual relations within the family [UCA 76-5-406].</p><p><strong>SHELTER HEARING: </strong>Shall be held within 72 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) of removal of a child from his home due to abuse, neglect, or dependency [UCA 78-3a-306]. An Assistant Attorney General files a petition in the juvenile court asking for temporary custody of a child who is alleged to be in imminent danger of physical or emotional harm if not removed from his home environment.</p><p><strong>SIX-MONTH CASE REVIEW: </strong>This review is to be held every six months as long as a child is in DCFS custody. The review may be held by the court, a DCFS administrative review panel, or a citizen review panel [UCA 78-3A-313]. Foster parents may attend, give input, provide written comments prior to the review, or participate by telephone if unable to attend administrative or citizen reviews.</p><p><strong>VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT: </strong>A voluntary agreement between the agency and the parents which grants temporary custody of a child to the state without court involvement for a period less than 45 days. (A second 45 day extension may be granted.) Voluntary placements are to be used to crisis situations where a short time placement will help resolve the family’s and the child’s difficulties. The agency will not assume responsibility to pay for any medical care of children placed into foster care on a voluntary basis.</p><p>Page 14</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p>The following information provides a snapshot of the decision-making involved in a typical child’s foster care journey. Practices may vary a bit from one county to another, but outlined below is the sequence of events that determine how a case progresses from intake to foster care placement to permanence.</p><p>A referral comes to the agency regarding risk of maltreatment to a child or a family of children. The referral may be provided by mandated reporter: a professional such as a teacher, clergy person, or social worker required to report suspicions of child maltreatment. Or the referral may be provided by law enforcement, a relative, a neighbor or family friend, or may be a self-referral by a parent or a child.</p><p>The agency determines through a standardized risk assessment whether child maltreatment is substantiated. The intake Caseworker will determine whether the child’s safety can be assured within his or her own family. The caseworker also determines what services would be necessary to support the family and assure safety for the child.</p><p>If temporary placement outside the home is needed to assure the child’s safety, kinship caregivers (relatives or other strong family connections) are sought so the child can be cared for by individuals within the child’s attachments, family system, neighborhood, and culture.</p><p>If no kin can be identified or located or none can provide safety, the child is removed and placed in a licensed foster home. Temporary custody is awarded to the DIVISION (not the foster caregiver) by Juvenile Court so the child’s safety can be assured by the child welfare agency. Attempts are made to keep siblings together when it is necessary to remove a family of children.</p><p>If the agency does not already hold temporary custody of the child, the division must file a complaint in the county’s Juvenile Court within one business day of the child’s removal from his family.</p><p>By the 90th day after the child’s removal from his family, a dispositional hearing is held in Juvenile Court, and a case plan is filed to identify the goal of the agency in meeting the best interests of the child. If the goal is reunification (the most commonly applied goal in child welfare), expectations of both the family and the division in working to achieve reunification are outlined.</p><p>Six months after the child’s removal from the home, a review hearing is held with parents, foster caregivers, agency staff, and other service providers to determine progress in meeting the goal identified on the case plan. Revisions or addenda to the case plan can be made at this time.</p><p>Twelve months after the child’s removal, a permanency hearing is held to review progress toward the identified goal. At this time, the court may choose one of the following options:</p><ul><li>Return the child to the primary parents with no restrictions</li><li>Return the child home with protective supervision by the division</li><li>Give legal custody to kin</li><li>Appoint a legal guardian</li><li>Terminate parental rights and/or reunification services and give permanent custody of the child to the agency for purposes of adoption</li><li>Extend the agency’s temporary custody of the child up to six months due to extenuating circumstances</li><li>Change the child’s legal status to Individualized Permanency. This legal status is typically given to children who cannot be reunified with their primary parents, have no safe kinship options, but who are refusing adoption as a case plan goal.</li></ul><p>Page 12</p>\n  </div>"

In the notes section, provide an example from the module.</em></p><p><strong>RECOGNIZE THE IMPACT TRAUMA HAS ON YOUR CHILD:</strong> Children who have survived trauma can present incredible challenges. When viewed through the lens of their traumatic experience many of these behaviors and reactions begin to make sense. Understanding trauma can help you identify effective strategies to address challenging behaviors and help your child develops new, more positive coping skills.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HELP YOUR CHILD TO FEEL SAFE:</strong> Safety is critical for children who have experienced trauma. Many are in a constant state of alert for the next threat to their well-being. They may be physically safe and still not feel psychologically safe. Keep your child’s trauma history in mind and establish an environment that is physically safe and work with your child to understand what it will take to create psychological safety.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HELP YOUR CHILD UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE OVERWHELMING EMOTIONS: </strong>Trauma can cause such intense fear, anger, shame, and helplessness that children are overwhelmed by their feelings. Trauma can also derail development so that children fail to learn how to identify, express, or manage their emotional states. Provide calm, consistent, and loving care to set an example for your children and teach them how to define, express, and manage their emotions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HELP YOUR CHILD UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE DIFFICULT BEHAVIOR:</strong> Overwhelming emotion can have a negative impact on children’s behavior, particularly if they cannot make the connection between feelings and behaviors. Because trauma can derail development, children who have experienced trauma may display problem behaviors more typical of younger children. Help your children understand the links between their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and take control of their behavioral responses.</p><p><strong>RESPECT AND SUPPORT THE POSITIVE, STABLE, AND ENDURING RELATIONSHIPS IN THE LIFE OF YOUR CHILD:</strong> Children learn who they are and what they world is like through the connections they make with other people. Positive, stable relationships play a vital role in helping children heal from trauma. Children who have been abused or neglected often have insecure attachments to other people. Nevertheless, they may cling to these attachments, which are disrupted or even destroyed when they come into care. Help your child hold on to what was good about these connections, reshape them, and build new healthier relationships with you and others as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HELP YOUR CHILD DEVELOP A STRENGTH-BASED UNDERSTANDING OF HIS OR HER LIFE STORY:</strong> To heal from trauma, children need to develop a strong sense of self, put their trauma histories in perspective, and recognize that they are worthwhile and valued individuals. Help children to develop a strength-based understanding of their life stories.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BE AN ADVOCATE FOR YOU CHILD:</strong> Trauma can affect so many aspects of a child’s life that it takes a team of people and agencies to facilitate recovery. You are a critical part of this team. Ensure efforts are coordinated and help others to view your children through a trauma lens.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PROMOTE AND SUPPORT TRAUMA-FOCUSED ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT FOR YOUR CHILD:</strong> Children who have experienced trauma often need specialized assessment and treatment. The effects of trauma may be misunderstood or even misdiagnosed. Fortunately, there are trauma-focused treatments whose effectiveness has been established. Use your understanding of trauma and its effects to advocate for the appropriate treatment for your child.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF</strong>: Caring for children who have experienced trauma can be difficult and can leave resource families feeling drained and exhausted. To be effective, take care of yourself, and take action to get the support you need when caring for traumatized children.</p><p>Page 9</p>\n  </div>"

A combination of the parents' resources and subsidy should cover the ordinary and special needs expenses of the child projected over an extended period.</div><div>(3) The amount of the monthly subsidy may not exceed the payment that would be made if the child was placed in a foster family home at the point in time when the agreement is being initiated or revised.</div><div>(4) The amount of monthly subsidy may increase or decrease when the child's level of need or the family's ability to meet those needs changes. The family or the Child and Family Services worker may initiate a request for a change in the amount of subsidy up to two times per fiscal year, when needs or resources change.</div><div>(5) If the adoptive family is receiving post adoption services and has an open Child and Family Services case, a change in the amount of subsidy may be initiated at any time during the open case to address service needs.</div><div>(6) For a child in public foster care, the requested amount of monthly subsidy is negotiated between the adoptive parent and the Child and Family Services worker. Before subsidy negotiation, the adoptive parents must have reviewed the child's case file information and discussed in depth with the Child and Family Services worker what will be needed after the child leaves state's custody.</div><div>(7) The amount of the monthly subsidy is subject to the approval of the regional adoption assistance committee. If the requested amount is not granted, the adoptive parent has a right to appeal as stated in Section R512-43-12.</div><div>(8) Utilizing the level of need criteria specified in Section R512-43-5, the Child and Family Services worker and adoptive family identify the child's level of need.</div><div>(9) The Child and Family Services worker and adoptive family shall identify the applicable monthly subsidy payment range, according to the child's specified level of need, as specified in Section R512-43-5.</div><div>(10) The Child and Family Services worker and adoptive family shall negotiate the amount of monthly subsidy to be requested from the regional adoption assistance committee.

If the requested amount is not approved or is reduced by the committee, Child and Family Services shall send a written notice to the adoptive parents within 30 days informing them of the process to request a fair hearing.</div><div>(12) The level of need is determined by considering the child's age, history, physical, mental, emotional, and social functioning and needs, and any other relevant factors. Frequency of occurrence, duration, severity, and number of needs or problem areas are also considered.</div><div>(13) The presence of a particular issue listed within a designated level does not mandate that the child be categorized at that level as the child's needs, taken as a whole, determine the level selected for the child.</div><div>(14) The level of need is classified into three categories.</div><div>(a) Level one applies to a child with a minimal number and severity of needs. It is expected that most of these issues will improve with time, and significant improvement may be anticipated over the course of the adoption.</div><div>(i) For children ages five and under issues may include feeding problems, aggressive or self destructive behavior, victimization from sexual abuse, victimization from physical abuse; or no more than one developmental delay in fine motor, gross motor, cognitive or social and emotional domains.</div><div>(ii) For children ages six through 18, issues may include social conflict, physical aggression, minor sexual reactivity, need for education resource classes or tutoring, minor medical problems requiring ongoing monitoring, or mental health issues requiring time limited counseling.</div><div>(b) Level two applies to a child with a moderate number and severity of needs.</div><div>(i) It is expected that a number of these issues are long-term in nature and the adoptive family and child will be working with them over the course of the adoption, and may intensify or worsen if not managed carefully.</div><div>(ii) Outside provider support will probably continue to be needed during the adoption.</div><div>(iii) For children ages five and under, issues may include developmental delays in two or more areas of fine motor, gross motor, cognitive or social and emotional domains; diagnosis of failure to thrive; moderate genetic disease or physical disability condition; or physical aggression expressed several times a week, including superficial injury to self or others.</div><div>(iv) For children ages six to 18, issues may include daily social conflict or serious withdrawn behavior; moderate risk of harm to self or others due to physically aggressive behavior; emotional or psychological issues with a mental health diagnosis requiring ongoing counseling sessions over an extended period; moderate sexual reactivity or perpetration; chronic patterns of being destructive to items or property; cruelty to animals; mild cognitive disability, autism, or fetal alcohol spectrum disorder with ongoing need for special education services; and physical disabilities requiring ongoing attendant care or other caretaker support.</div><div>(c) Level three applies to a child with a significant number or high severity of needs.</div><div>(i) It is expected that these issues will not moderate and may become more severe over time.</div><div>(ii) The child's level of need may require personal attendant care or specialized care outside of the home, when prescribed by a professional.</div><div>(iii) For children ages five and under issues may include severe life threatening medical issues; moderate or severe cognitive disability, autism, or fetal alcohol spectrum disorder; serious developmental delays in three or more areas of fine or gross motor, cognitive or social and emotional domains; anticipated need for ongoing support for activities of daily living, such as feeding, dressing and self care; or high levels of threat for harm to self or others due to aggressive behaviors.</div><div>(iv) For children ages six to 18 issues may include moderate or severe retardation or autism; life threatening medical issues; severe physical disabilities not expected to improve over time; predatory sexual perpetration; high risk of serious injury to self or others due to aggressive behavior; serious attempts or threats of suicide; severely inhibiting diagnosed mental health disorders diagnosed within the past year that limit normal social and emotional development, such as a need for ongoing self contained or special education services.</div><div>(15) The regional adoption assistance committee must approve the level of need identified for the child.</div><div>(16) A child's need level may be increased in severity by one level if the adoption assistance committee determines that the child's permanency may be compromised due to financial barriers to the child's adoption and if at least one of the following circumstances apply:</div><div>(a) the child has been in state custody for longer than 24 months;</div><div>(b) the child is nine years of age or older; or</div><div>(c) the child is part of a sibling group of three or more children being placed together for adoption.</div><div>(17) Each level of need corresponds to a dollar range in the amount of monthly subsidy that may be paid for a child, with the specific amount based upon the individual child's needs and the family's ability to meet those needs.</div><div>(18) The monthly subsidy amount for an individual child may not exceed the maximum amount for the payment range applicable to the child's level of need.</div><div>(19) A family may choose to defer receipt of a monthly subsidy that a child qualifies for, with the option to initiate a monthly subsidy at a later date.</div><div>(20) A family may choose to receive a lesser amount than would be allowable for the level of need at a given point in time.</div><div>(21) Monthly subsidy payments for a child's needs categorized as level one range from 0% to 40% of the maximum maintenance payment that could be paid for a child in a foster family home in State Fiscal Year 2023.</div><div>(22) A family may choose to receive a lesser amount than would be allowable for the child's level of need at a given point in time.</div><div>(23) Monthly subsidy payments for a child's needs categorized as level two range from 20% to 70% of the maximum maintenance payment that could be paid for a child in a foster family home in State Fiscal Year 2023.</div><div>(24) Monthly subsidy payments for a child's needs categorized as level three range from 50% to 100% of the maximum maintenance payment that could be paid for a child in a foster family home in State Fiscal Year 2023.</div><div>(25) For extraordinary, infrequent, or uncommon documented needs that cannot be covered by a monthly subsidy or state medical assistance, refer to supplemental adoption assistance in Section R512-43-7.</div><div>(26) The two funding sources for the monthly subsidy are Title IV-E adoption assistance and state adoption assistance funds. The child's eligibility determines which funding source is used for payment.</div><div>(27) Title IV-E adoption assistance shall be considered first for the monthly subsidy. To receive Title IV-E adoption assistance, a child with special needs shall meet at least one of the following federal requirements:</div><div>(a) a child is determined eligible for SSI for a disability by the Social Security Administration before the initiation of adoption proceedings;</div><div>(b) a child in foster care who meets the age criteria defined by the federal fiscal year qualifies for Title IV-E adoption assistance if other enhanced eligibility criteria is met;</div><div>(c) a child in foster care who has been in foster care for any previous 60 consecutive months may qualify for Title IV-E Adoption Assistance if other enhanced eligibility criteria is met;</div><div>(d) a child in foster care who is a sibling of another child in foster care who qualifies under the enhanced age criteria and is being adopted into the same family may qualify for Title IV-E adoption assistance if other enhanced eligibility criteria is met;</div><div>(e) the removal home for the child in public foster care received, or would have been eligible to receive, AFDC before removal, and the child was removed from the home as a result of a judicial determination that remaining in the home would be contrary to the child's welfare;</div><div>(f) the child was voluntarily placed for foster care with the state, and was or would have been AFDC eligible at the time of voluntary placement if application had been made, the child lived with a specified relative within the six months before the voluntary placement, and Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments were made on behalf of the child;</div><div>(g) the child's needs were met through foster care maintenance payments made to and for the child's minor parents as provided by Subsection 475(4)(B) of the Social Security Act; or</div><div>(h) the child had a previous IV-E adoption assistance agreement.</div><div>(28) The adoptive family may use state adoption assistance funds for the monthly subsidy if the qualified child is not eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance.</div><div>(29) The monthly subsidy may be used according to the parents' discretion. Examples of the uses of the monthly subsidy payment are:</div><div>(a) medical, dental, or mental health services not paid for by the state medical assistance or family insurance;</div><div>(b) special equipment for physically or mentally challenged children;</div><div>(c) respite care;</div><div>(d) child care;</div><div>(e) therapeutic equipment;</div><div>(f) minor renovation of the home to meet special needs of the child;</div><div>(g) damage and repairs;</div><div>(h) speech therapy;</div><div>(i) tutoring;</div><div>(j) specialized preschool based on needs of the child;</div><div>(k) private school;</div><div>(l) exceptional basic needs such as special food, clothing, and shelter;</div><div>(m) visitations with biological relatives; and</div><div>(n) cultural and heritage activities and information.</div><div>(30) The adoption assistance agreement will specify the child's eligibility for Title XIX and Title XX services, if available.</div><p>Page 2</p>\n  </div>"

If an applicant cannot write, the applicant must mark on the application form and have at least one witness to the signature.<br>(i) An electronic signature is legal in accordance with Section 46-4-201.<br>(ii) An electronic signature must be retrievable as evidence of the individual's case record.<br>(b) A representative may apply on behalf of an individual. A representative may be a legal guardian, a person holding a power of attorney, a representative payee or other responsible person acting on behalf of the individual. In this case, the eligibility agency may send notices, requests and forms to both the individual and the individual's representative, or to just the individual's representative. The eligibility agency may assign someone to act as the authorized representative when the individual requires help to apply and cannot appoint a representative.<br>(c) If the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) has custody of a child and the child is placed in foster care, DCFS must complete the application. DCFS determines eligibility for the child pursuant to a written agreement with the Department. DCFS also determines eligibility for children placed under a subsidized adoption agreement. The Department does not require an application for Title IV-E eligible children.</p><p>(2) The application date for medical assistance is the date the eligibility agency receives the application during normal business hours on a week day that does not include Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday except as described in Subsection (2):<br>(a) When the individual applies through the federally facilitated marketplace (FFM) and the application is transferred from the FFM for a Medicaid eligibility determination, the date of application is the date the individual applies through the FFM;<br>(b) If the application is delivered to the eligibility agency after the close of business, the date of application is the next business day;<br>(c) If the applicant delivers the application to an outreach location during normal business hours, the date of application is that business day when outreach staff is available to receive the application. If the applicant delivers the application to an outreach location on a non-business day or after normal business hours, the date of application is the last business day that a staff person from the eligibility agency is available at the outreach location to receive or pick up the application;<br>(d) When the eligibility agency receives application data transmitted from the Social Security Administration (SSA) pursuant to the requirements of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1320b-14(c), the eligibility agency shall use the date that the individual submits the application for the low-income subsidy to the SSA as the application date for Medicare cost-sharing programs. The application processing period for the transmitted data begins on the date the eligibility agency receives the transmitted data. The transmitted data meets the signature requirements for applications for Medicare cost-sharing programs;<br>(e) If an application is filed through the \"myCase\" system, the date of application is the date the application is submitted to the eligibility agency online.</p><p>(3) The eligibility agency shall accept a signed application that an applicant sends by facsimile as a valid application.</p><p>(4) If an applicant submits an unsigned or incomplete application form to the eligibility agency, the eligibility agency shall notify the applicant to sign and complete the application no later than the last day of the application processing period. The eligibility agency shall send a signature page to the applicant and give the applicant at least 10 days to sign and return the signature page. When the application is incomplete, the eligibility agency shall notify the applicant of the need to complete the application and offer ways to complete the application.<br>(a) The date of application for an incomplete or unsigned application form is the date the eligibility agency receives the application if the agency receives a signed signature page and completed application within the application processing period.<br>(b) If the eligibility agency does not receive a signed signature page and completed application form within the application processing period, the application is void and the eligibility agency shall send a denial notice to the applicant.<br>(c) If the eligibility agency receives a signed signature page and completed application within 30 calendar days after the notice of denial date, the date of receipt is the new application date and the Subsection (2) applies.<br>(d) If the eligibility agency receives a signed signature page and completed application more than 30 calendar days after it sends the denial notice, the applicant must reapply by completing and submitting a new application form. The new application date is determined in accordance with this rule.</p><p>(5) The eligibility agency treats the following situations as a new application without requiring a new application form. The application date is the day the eligibility agency receives the request or verification from the recipient. The effective date of eligibility for these situations depends on the rules for the specific program.<br>(a) A household with an open medical assistance case must ask to add a new household member by contacting the eligibility agency.<br>(b) The eligibility agency shall end medical assistance when the recipient fails to return requested verification, and the recipient must provide requested verification to the eligibility agency before the end of the calendar month that follows the closure date. The eligibility agency waives the requirement for the open enrollment period during that calendar month for programs subject to open enrollment.<br>(c) The eligibility agency shall end a medical assistance program due to an incomplete review, and the recipient must respond to the review request within the three calendar months that follow the closure date.<br>(d) Except for Targeted Adult Medicaid and Utah's Premium Partnership for Health Insurance (UPP) that are subject to open enrollment periods, the eligibility agency shall deny an application when the applicant fails to provide requested verification, but provides requested verification within 30 calendar days of the denial notice date. The new application date is the date the eligibility agency receives requested verification and the retroactive period is based on that date. The eligibility agency does not act if it receives verification more than 30 calendar days after it denies the application. The recipient must complete a new application to reapply for medical assistance.<br>(e) For Targeted Adult Medicaid and UPP applicants, the eligibility agency shall deny an application when the applicant fails to provide requested verification, but provides requested verification within 30 calendar days of the denial notice date and the eligibility agency has not stopped the open enrollment period. If the eligibility agency has stopped enrollment, the applicant must wait for an open enrollment period to reapply.</p><p>(6) For an individual who applies for and is found ineligible for Medicaid from October 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013, the eligibility agency shall redetermine eligibility under the policies that become effective January 1, 2014, using the modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)-based methodology without requiring a new application.<br>(a) Medicaid eligibility may begin no earlier than January 1, 2014, for an individual who becomes eligible using the MAGI-based methodology.<br>(b) For applications received on or after January 1, 2014, the eligibility agency shall apply the MAGI-based methodology first to determine Medicaid eligibility.<br>(c) The eligibility agency shall determine eligibility for other Medicaid programs that do not use MAGI-based methodology if the individual meets the categorical requirements of these programs, which may include a medically needy eligibility group for individuals found ineligible using the MAGI-based methodology.</p><p>(7) If a medical assistance case closes for one or more calendar months, the recipient must complete a new application form to reapply, except as defined in Subsection R414-308-6(7).</p><p>(8) An individual determined eligible for a presumptive eligibility period must file an application for medical assistance with the eligibility agency in accordance with the requirements of Sections 1920, 1920A, and 1920B of the Social Security Act.</p><p>(9) The eligibility agency shall process low-income subsidy application data transmitted from SSA in accordance with 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1320b-14(c) as an application for Medicare cost-sharing programs. The eligibility agency shall take appropriate steps to gather the required information and verification from the applicant to determine the applicant's eligibility.<br>(a) Data transmitted from SSA is not an application for Medicaid.<br>(b) An individual who wants to apply for Medicaid when contacted for information to process the application for Medicare cost-sharing programs must complete and sign a Department-approved application form for medical assistance. The date of application for Medicaid is the date the eligibility agency receives the application for Medicaid.</p><p>Page 1</p>\n  </div>"

This is the home of the person who under state law had the legal right and responsibility for the child immediately before DFPS removed the child, which is usually the parent or managing conservator.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">DFPS staff can use the following sources of information to help identify the home of removal:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">The removal order, which may name one or both of the following:<ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">The adult from whom the court legally removed the child.</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">The adult who is the subject of the court’s “contrary to the welfare” finding.</li></ul></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">The petition for removal, when the home from which the child is legally removed is not identified in the court order.</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Interim Caregiver</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">An interim caregiver is a related or unrelated person with whom the child is living at the time the court orders the removal of the child.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If the child is living with an interim caregiver at the time the court judicially (legally) removes the child from the parent, the following apply:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">The AFDC home of removal is the home of the person from whom the court legally removed the child, regardless of whether that is the parent’s home.</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">DFPS uses the AFDC home of removal to determine whether the child is eligible for AFDC, even if DFPS physically removed the child from the interim caregiver’s home.</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>AFDC Eligibility Month</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The AFDC eligibility month is the month DFPS uses to determine whether the child was eligible for AFDC in the home of removal. The AFDC eligibility month is the month in which the court proceedings that led to the court removing the child from the home began.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The court proceedings are considered to be initiated on the date that DFPS files the petition of removal. If a removal petition is not filed or is filed after the initial removal court order, the initiation of court proceedings is the date of the initial removal court order.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Use of Home of Removal and Eligibility Month</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">All factors related to AFDC eligibility (including parental deprivation, resources, and income) are based on the circumstances in the AFDC home of removal during the AFDC eligibility month. This applies even if the child did not live with that parent or other specified relative (see&nbsp;Specified Relatives, below) when DFPS removed the child.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Child Living with and Removed from the Same Specified Relative</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">To be eligible for AFDC, the child must have lived with and been legally removed from the same specified relative (see&nbsp;Specified Relatives, below). There are two ways to meet this requirement:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">The child was judicially (legally) removed from a specified relative and was also living with that relative in the month of the initiation of court proceedings.</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">The child was judicially (legally) removed from a specified relative and had lived with that relative within six months of the initiation of court proceedings.</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">If the court legally removed the child from a specified relative, but DFPS allowed the child to remain in that relative’s home, this is not a removal for Title IV-E purposes. In this situation, the child is ineligible for Title IV-E assistance for the entire foster care episode. A foster care episode is the time period from when the court legally orders the child’s removal to when the court dismisses the conservatorship case.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Specified Relatives</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The following people may be considered specified relatives of a child:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Father or mother</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Grandfather or grandmother</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Brother or sister</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Uncle or aunt</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">First cousin</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Nephew or niece</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Stepfather or stepmother</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Stepbrother or stepsister</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">First cousin once removed</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Each relationship listed above includes the following people:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Biological and adoptive relatives.</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">The spouse of any person who is eligible to be a specified relative, even after the marriage has ended in death or divorce.</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Relatives up to and including the degree of “great-great” for uncle and aunt.</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Relatives up to and including the degree of “great-great-great” for grandfather and grandmother.</li></ul><p class=\"text-align-right\" dir=\"ltr\">45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §233.90(c)(1)(v)(1-4)</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Constructive Removal</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In a constructive removal, all of the following occur:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">The child is currently living with an interim caregiver who provides a stable environment.</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">DFPS files suit against the parent or the person with managing conservatorship of the child, but the child is not living with that person.</li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">DFPS decides to leave the child in the interim caregiver’s home.</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">In a constructive removal, the AFDC home of removal is the home from which the court legally removed the child (the parent’s home or the home of the person with managing conservatorship), not the interim caregiver’s home. In order to be eligible for AFDC, the child must have lived with the person from whom the court legally removed the child at some point during the six months before the removal.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Other Circumstances of Living with a relative</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Child in Residential Treatment Facility or Hospital</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">A child’s parent places him or her in a residential treatment facility or a medical or psychiatric hospital without DFPS involvement. The child remains there for more than six months, but his or her parent maintains parental responsibility for the child. Then, DFPS files a petition for removal while the child is still in the facility.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In this circumstance, the child is considered to be living with his or her parent, because the parent placed the child in the facility and maintained parental responsibility. All other IV-E requirements must still be met for the case to be certified for IV-E.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The AFDC eligibility month is the month in which the court proceedings that led to the court removing the child began. This is the month when DFPS filed the petition for removal.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Child Born to a Mother Who Is in Prison or in a Hospital</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">A woman gives birth while in prison or in a hospital, and therefore she is not able to care for her child, so DFPS places the child into foster care.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In this circumstance, the child is considered to be living with the mother because federal policy considers the prison or hospital to be a home. All other IV-E requirements must still be met for the case to be certified for IV-E</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The AFDC eligibility month is the month in which the court proceedings that led to the court removing the child began. This is the month when DFPS filed the petition for removal.</p>\n  </div>"

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to announce the implementation of a special service fee for family reunification support. This special service fee provides reimbursement of foster and relative caregivers participating together with parents of children in their care in specified activities in support of family reunification. The caseworker for the child(ren) reviews past activities and guides planning for future activities together with parents and caregivers at monthly meetings or supportive visits. The fee is available as long as a parent is making progress toward reunification.</p><p>This special service fee strengthens Department support of reunification of children with their family of origin. Child and Family Service Reviews indicate that family engagement activities involving families of children in care in planning and decision making, encouraging caregiver support of birth families and facilitating visits between children in foster care and their parents contribute to the success of family reunification efforts. Family engagement activities have the greatest impact when initiated soon after the child is removed from the family.</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>The primary users of this Policy Guide are foster and relative caregivers for children with a goal of return home who are engaged in qualifying activities with the parent(s) of the child(ren) in their care, DCFS and Purchase of Service (POS) permanency caseworkers and supervisors.</p><p><strong>III.ELIGIBILITY AND DOCUMENTATION</strong></p><p>All activities must meet the requirements set out on the <strong>CFS1042-L, Family Reunification Support Special Service Fee Log</strong>. They must be recorded on the log along with the signature of the participating parent(s) and caregiver(s) at the time of the event, and reviewed by the parent, caregiver and caseworker together monthly. Eligibility for reimbursement requires caseworker and supervisor approval of the CFS 1042-L documentation of caregiver and parent engagement in activities, together with supervisor confirmation that the parent(s) are progressing toward reunification. Instructions for reimbursement and specific requirements are set out on the reverse side of the CFS 1042-L.</p><p><strong>IV.

Reimbursement is available at 4 levels based on the number of parent-caregiver activities during the month, with 3 qualifying activities required at each level. Parent and caregiver must both participate and sign off on the log for the activity to qualify for the Reunification Support Special Service Fee.</p><p><strong>Family Setting Activities</strong></p><p>At least 2 activities at each level must engage parents in activities with their children in a family setting. The activity qualifies for caregiver reimbursement if the caregiver provides the location, supervision, mentoring or transportation for these activities. Family setting means the home of the caregiver, parent, relative, friend or a church or community institution that offers an appropriate environment for parenting activities such as help with homework, hobbies, meal preparation, grooming, chores, getting ready for nap or bedtime. If a parent is hospitalized, in a residential treatment facility or incarcerated, then a visit in the visiting room of the institution is credited as a visit in a family setting.</p><p>The requirement that two activities at each level be held in a family setting is waived for the first two months of the Reunification Support fee to permit caregiver and parent to get to know one another and to identify appropriate settings for parenting activities. Caseworkers are encouraged to begin the reunification support special service fee log with caregivers and parents at the first family meeting when planning for visits and shared parenting activities or as soon thereafter as is appropriate for the parties involved.</p><p><strong>Choice Activities</strong></p><p>The third activity in each level may also be in a family setting or may be any of the following:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Shared parenting activities related to medical, educational, religious or social needs of the child, see Permanency Planning Policy and Practice Guide 9.5.5.</li><li>Planning meeting with caseworker and parent, supportive visits, Child and Family Team meeting, or Administrative Case Review with parent.</li><li>Participation in parenting classes with parent.</li><li>Attendance at court hearing for child with parent.</li><li>Participation in family counseling toward reunification.</li><li>Respite or other services rendered in support of the family between return home and case closure.</li></ul><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>Instructions for Use of Reunification Support Special Service Fee Log</strong></p><p>Caregivers seeking reimbursement for Reunification Support Special Service Fee must document completion of qualifying activities on the log on the reverse side of this page. Reimbursement acknowledges 4 levels of frequency of Reunification Support activity and is designed to reward the effort required to achieve continuity of contact. To qualify for reimbursement the log must have at least 3 approved events. Each level of reimbursement must include at least 2 family setting activities.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Level 1</td><td>3 activities</td><td>$75</td></tr><tr><td>Level 2</td><td>6 activities</td><td>$150</td></tr><tr><td>Level 3</td><td>9 activities</td><td>$250</td></tr><tr><td>Level 4</td><td>12 activities</td><td>$400</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Reunification Support log tracks reimbursable activity for an entire month. A new log is required for each month of reimbursement. An entry is made for each activity and is signed by the caregiver and participating parent at the time that the activity occurs. The log is submitted by the parent and caregiver to the child’s caseworker, and together the three review the past month and plan for the coming month. Each log must be approved by the supervisor. The amount of the fee is calculated monthly based on the reported activity. Payment is based on levels completed. The minimum payment is $75 for completion of Level 1. The maximum is $400 for completion through Level 4 with 12 qualifying activities within the month, 8 of which engage parents in activities with their children in a family setting.</p><p>Reimbursement for Reunification Support includes mileage, child care, incidentals that occur as a result of caregiver time spent in this activity, expenses incurred in qualifying cultural/educational/recreational activities with the parent(s) and child(ren) and activities that may include other family members such as children’s birthday parties, family reunions, and observation of holidays.</p><p><strong>Reunification Support Special Service Fee Not to Duplicate Sibling Visit or Other Special Service Fees</strong>--If reunification is sought and siblings are in separate placements, all siblings should be included in the family visits and reimbursement sought under the Reunification Support Fee whenever possible. In the case of a no contact order or other circumstances requiring sibling visits separate from family visits, both reunification support and sibling visits may qualify for special service fees. In no case may a visit be considered as a Reunification Support Special Service Fee required activity and be considered for any other special service fee.</p><p><strong>Caseworker and supervisor must submit a completed 906-4 with reason code 17, along with a copy of the signed CFS__, Reunification Support Special Service Fee Log reflecting the activities for the entire previous month to Central Payment Unit at FAX 217/557-0639. All activity for the month must be on one log.</strong></p>\n  </div>"

BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>In Cook County, the Cook County Public Guardian (Public Guardian) is the appointed attorney and guardian ad litem (GAL) for the majority of minors for whom the Department is awarded legal custody. &nbsp;In accordance with the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act (ANCRA) (325 ILCS 5), Juvenile Court Act of 1987 (705 ILCS 405), and Department Rules 300, Reports of Abuse and Neglect; the Department is required to transmit a copy of the report and investigative file to the GAL appointed under the Juvenile Court Act when the a report has been indicated, unfounded, or undetermined and the minor who is the subject of the report is also the minor for whom the GAL has been appointed.&nbsp;</p><p>The Public Guardian brought a lawsuit that resulted in a court order requiring the Department to implement new procedures for providing investigative files to the Public Guardian. &nbsp;These procedures only apply to investigations involving children represented by the Cook County Public Guardian.</p><p>The main requirement of the court order is that the Department must provide the Public Guardian with information regarding the identity of the reporter and source of information and all other information regarding the minor contained in the investigative file. &nbsp;The Department and the Public Guardian agreed to settle the remaining issues in the litigation under the terms specified in this policy guide.</p><p><strong>IV. FINAL FINDINGS OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT REPORTS INVOLVING DEPARTMENT WARDS</strong></p><p>After the report is classified, the person making the classification shall determine whether the child named in the report is the subject of an action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If the child is the subject of an action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act, the Department shall transmit a copy of the report to the guardian ad litem appointed for the child under Section 2-17 of the Juvenile Court Act [ANCRA, 325 ILCS 5/714].</p><p>Whenever the Department determines that a reported incident of child abuse or neglect from a mandated reporter or any other reporter is \"unfounded\", the minor's guardian ad litem appointed under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 may request a review of the investigation within 10 days of the notification of the final finding if the subject of the report is also the minor for whom the guardian ad litem has been appointed [ANCRA, 325 ILCS 5/7.21].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>V.

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to issue procedures for background checks that must be done prior to subsidy approval on all members of the foster home/caregiver household, ages 13 and over. This includes cases of DCFS wards moving to adoption or transfer of guardianship. The required timeframes for the background checks are indicated within these procedures.</p><p>This Policy Guide does not apply to requirements for background checks at the time of a child’s initial placement with an unlicensed relative, nor at the time of initial foster home licensure.</p><p>This Policy Guide conforms to the requirements of the Adam Walsh Act, the Adoption Act and the Child Care Act.</p><p><strong>Background checks on licensed providers/foster homes are no longer required for pre-screening and/or legal screenings</strong> for the purpose of:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>filing a petition for Termination of Parental Rights;</li><li>transfer of guardianship (KinGap); or</li><li>Expedited Adoption.</li></ul><p>For unlicensed providers, in addition to being fingerprinted for a background check at the time of the initial placement as provided in Rule 385, Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking System (CANTS) and Law Enforcement Agencies Data System (LEADS) and Sex Offender Registry checks must still be updated every six months.</p><p>Regardless whether a caregiver is licensed or not, everyone in the home age 17 and over must be fingerprinted for a background check, including any ward of the State residing in the home.</p><p><strong>II. ADOPTION/TRANSFER OF GUARDIANSHIP CASES: LICENSED PROVIDERS / FOSTER HOMES</strong></p><p>For all subsidized adoption or guardianship cases involving licensed foster family homes, the background checks listed below must have been conducted by the caseworker/licensing representative within <strong>2</strong> years prior to the subsidy approval:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking System (CANTS) and Sex Offender Registry (SOR) checks of all household members ages 13 and over.</li><li>Fingerprint-based Illinois State Police (ISP) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) checks of all household members ages 17 and over.</li></ol><p>If the household member is a ward of the State, see <strong>Section IV</strong> of this Policy Guide for instructions.</p><p>The results of the background check may be located on either the BC-11 or BC 04 and BC-05 screens and/or the Licensed Provider’s Individual License Summary (ILS) located in their licensing file. <strong>See Section V of this Policy Guide for instructions on the process for obtaining the background checks</strong> if the background checks have not been updated within the last two years and/or there is missing/inaccurate information.</p><p>Background check information on wards ages 13 and over currently living in the home will not be listed on the ILS but will be contained in the Licensed Provider’s licensing file. All arrests and convictions shall be explained in the <strong>CFS 411, Report of Investigation</strong> and the <strong>CFS 486, Adoption Conversion Assessment</strong> forms.</p><p>If any household member has a criminal conviction listed in <strong>Rule 385, Appendix A</strong> and/or an indicated report of an allegation listed in <strong>Section 385.50</strong>, this finding must be resolved before the adoption/transfer of guardianship can proceed. In case of DCFS wards with convictions or indicated reports, see <strong>Section IV</strong> of this Policy Guide for instructions.</p><p>The <strong>CFS 718-L, Request for Updated Background Check for a Licensed Provider</strong> form shall be used for CANTS, SOR, ISP and FBI clearances for providers that have an active license.</p><p><strong>III. ADOPTION CASES: UNLICENSED PROVIDERS / FOSTER HOMES</strong></p><p>For all cases moving toward adoption involving DCFS wards placed in unlicensed homes, the background checks listed below must be conducted by the caseworker prior to the subsidy approval within the required time frame. Please see <strong>Section VI</strong> of this Policy Guide for instructions on the process for obtaining the background checks:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking System (CANTS), Sex Offender Registry (SOR) and name-based Law Enforcement Agencies Data System (LEADS) checks on all household members ages 13 and over <strong>within the 6 months</strong> prior to the subsidy approval.</li><li>Fingerprint-based Illinois State Police (ISP) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) checks of all household members ages 17 and over within <strong>2</strong> years prior to the subsidy approval.</li></ol><p>All arrests and convictions shall be explained in the <strong>CFS 411, Report of Investigation</strong> and the <strong>CFS 486, Adoption Conversion Assessment</strong> forms.</p><p>If the household member is a ward of the State, see <strong>Section IV</strong> of this Policy Guide for instructions.</p><p>If it is determined that any household member has a criminal conviction as listed in <strong>Rule 385, Appendix A</strong> and/or indicated reports of allegations listed in <strong>Section 385.50</strong>, this finding must be resolved before the adoption can proceed.</p><p>In addition, the <strong>CFS 718-RL, Authorization for Background Check for RELATIVES Applying for Foster Home License</strong> shall be used for ISP and FBI clearances for unlicensed relatives that are adopting, as well a re-adoption of a previously adopted ward by a person (even if not a relative), to whom DCFS has agreed to provide a non-ward subsidy, and in interstate adoption cases. The individual’s provider ID number must be included on the <strong>CFS 718-RL</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>CANTS 48, Request for LEADS-CANTS Check</strong> shall be used to obtain the CANTS and LEADS background checks.</p><p>The Illinois and National Sex Offender Registries’ websites shall be used to obtain the SOR checks.

DCFS WARDS</strong></p><p>If a DCFS ward is a member of the household, the <strong>CFS 718-W, Authorization for Background Check of Wards of the State</strong> shall be completed for the background check. If the home is unlicensed, the workers need to use this form for ISP/FBI only and do their own CANTS/LEADS/SOR checks.</p><p>The caseworker shall complete a <strong>CFS 596-G-W, Protective Plan</strong> for any DCFS ward with convictions listed in <strong>Rule 385, Appendix A</strong> and/or indicated reports of allegations listed in <strong>Section 385.50</strong>. This Protective Plan shall be part of the licensing file (if applicable) as well as the ward’s case file. The caseworker, licensing representative (if applicable), foster parent and ward must participate together in developing and reviewing this Protective Plan. The Protective Plan must take into account each of the following:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>court provisions, such as home monitoring, terms of probation, any orders of protection, etc.;</li><li>the nature of the offense and how it affects other members of the household;</li><li>what steps will be taken to ensure safety in the home and who is responsible for monitoring; and</li><li>what level of supervision is needed, indicators to support supervision level and who will be responsible for monitoring the indicators and levels of supervision.</li></ol><p>The Protective Plan must be reviewed every six months or more frequently as needed. A ward’s criminal history will not impact a provider’s license.</p><p><strong>V. PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR LICENSED PROVIDERS / FOSTER HOMES</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Determine the current family composition of household members.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Compare the current family composition with what is listed on the BC11 screen or the Individual License Summary (ILS). Wards will not be added to the BC11 screen or ILS.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Determine if there are discrepancies. If yes, go to Step 4. If no, skip to Step 5.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong> (Discrepancy found)<br>Contact the licensing worker to correct any discrepancies between BC11/ILS and the family composition. If there are any household members, who require background checks that are not listed on the ILS, in most instances it will be the licensing worker’s responsibility for correcting and resolving this issue. However, Adoption staff and/or caseworkers may also assume responsibility for correcting and resolving this issue. You may not submit the CFS 718-L until the discrepancies have been resolved. Upon resolution, proceed to Step 6.</p><p><strong>Prior to sending a household member for fingerprinting the worker shall complete the following:</strong></p><p>Check the Background Check Unit – Finger Print Search website for each household member subject to an ISP and FBI check. The website address is: <a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"https://fingerprintsearch.dcfs.illinois.gov/.\" name=\"https://fingerprintsearch.dcfs.illinois.gov/.\">https://fingerprintsearch.dcfs.illinois.gov/.</a></p><p>Enter the following information: Provider ID (of the agency, not the individual; either the CWA provider ID or 999901 for DCFS); First Name; Last Name; Birth Date; Last 4 Digits of SSN and click on search.</p><p>If the screen indicates that prints are not on file, print the screen. The household member will need to take a CFS 718 and the screen print to Accurate Biometrics and be fingerprinted. After fingerprinting, Accurate Biometrics will issue a receipt for fingerprinting and will either stamp the CFS 718 and return the form or they may keep the copy. The household member will return the form and/or receipt to the worker who will forward it to Central Office of Licensing (COoL).</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong> (No discrepancies)<br>If there are no information discrepancies between the current household members and the BC-11/BC-05 screens or ILS, and all the above background check information is listed within two years with Clearances for subsidy approval, no additional steps may be needed.</p><p>If the BC-11/BC-05 screens or ILS indicate CL - no additional steps/documentation is needed.</p><p>If the BC-11/BC-05 screens or ILS indicate CH/CR - the rap sheet/criminal abstract and FBI response are required.</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:none;\" type=\"none\"><li><strong>NOTE: </strong>All other codes require additional response/documentation before proceeding to Step 6. Caseworkers should consult with their licensing supervisor, POS adoption liaison or DCFS adoption supervisor.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 6</strong> (Discrepancy resolved)<br>Complete the <strong>CFS 718-L</strong>, including all household members age 13 and over who are subject to background checks. The box “Adoption” or “Subsidized Guardianship” should be checked. Ensure that the form is complete and accurate.</p><p><strong>Step 7</strong><br>The worker shall submit the <strong>CFS 718-L</strong> directly to the “Permanency Updates” mailbox via DCFS Outlook and skip to the Disposition.</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:none;\" type=\"none\"><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Caseworkers shall communicate background check related information only via DCFS Outlook to ensure confidential and secure communication.</li></ul><p><strong>DISPOSITION</strong></p><p>The Central Office of Licensing (COoL) will conduct the background checks. If there are no “hits,” CYCIS will be updated to show “CL” (cleared). If there are hits, the rap sheet/printout with detail on arrests, charges and convictions will be sent to the caseworker/manager via DCFS Outlook (if there isn’t an Outlook account, results will be sent via USPS). CYCIS will reflect IS (ISP rap sheet sent) and/or FS (FBI rap sheet sent).</p><p>The caseworker and supervisor shall review all information to assess the safety and appropriateness of the provider before proceeding with the adoption/guardianship process.</p><p><strong>VI. PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING BACKGROUND CLEARANCES FOR UNLICENSED PROVIDERS</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Determine the current family composition of household members</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Determine what checks need to be done on each member in the family composition. Verify if the checks have already been conducted and if the dates of the results fall within the appropriate timeframe.</p><p>Household members ages 13 to 16 – CANTS, LEADS, and SOR<br>Household members ages 17 and older – CANTS, LEADS, SOR, and fingerprint-based ISP and FBI</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Complete the <strong>CANTS 48</strong> for each household member subject to a CANTS and LEADS check. Fax <strong>CANTS 48</strong> to the State Central Registry (SCR) – fax number is listed on form.

The website address is: <a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"https://fingerprintsearch.dcfs.illinois.gov/.\" name=\"https://fingerprintsearch.dcfs.illinois.gov/.\">https://fingerprintsearch.dcfs.illinois.gov/.</a></p><p>Enter the following information: Provider ID (of the agency, not the individual; either the CWA provider ID or 999901 for DCFS); First Name; Last Name; Birth Date; Last 4 Digits of SSN and click on search.</p><p><strong>Step 5 (a)</strong><br>If the screen indicates that prints are not on file, print the screen. The household member will need to take a <strong>CFS 718-RL</strong> and the Finger Print Search website screen print to Accurate Biometrics and be fingerprinted. After fingerprinting, Accurate Biometrics will stamp the <strong>CFS 718-RL</strong>. The household member will return the form to the worker who will forward it to COoL.</p><p><strong>Step 5 (b)</strong><br>For all household members whose prints are on file and subject to ISP and FBI checks, the worker shall complete the <strong>CFS 718-RL</strong>. The box “Adoption” should be checked.<br><em>Note: Unlicensed caregivers are not eligible for KinGap (subsidized guardianship).</em><br>Ensure that the form is complete and accurate.</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong><br>The worker shall submit the <strong>CFS 718-RL</strong> by fax to either 217-782-6446 or 217-785-6368.</p><p><strong>DISPOSITION</strong></p><p>COoL will conduct the background checks. If there are no hits, CYCIS will be updated to show “CL” (cleared). If there are hits, the rap sheet will be sent to the caseworker via DCFS Outlook (if there isn’t an Outlook account, results will be sent via USPS). CYCIS will reflect IS (ISP rap sheet sent) and FS (FBI rap sheet sent).</p><p>SCR will return the form with the results of the CANTS and LEADS checks.</p><p>The caseworker and supervisor shall review all information to assess the safety and appropriateness of the provider before proceeding with the adoption/guardianship process.</p><p><strong>VII.

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to implement an Office of the Inspector General recommendation that caseworker conduct pre adoptive collateral interviews with at least 3 subjects involved with the adoptive child and family in order to confirm the suitability of the adoptive placement. &nbsp;Previously, workers writing the home-study have interviewed the adoptive parents, and much of the self-reporting, without interviewing any “collateral” subjects, who may have provided information either positive of the arrangement or possibly of concern for the welfare of the child if the adoption were to be finalized. &nbsp;The <strong>CFS 486, Adoption Conversion Assessment</strong> form (attached) has been revised to reflect the new required collateral contacts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>Primary users of this Policy Guide are Statewide Adoption Coordinators, their staff, and DCFS and Private Agency Child Welfare Staff, and Supervisors&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III. CASEWORKER HOME-STUDY COLLATERAL INTERVIEWS</strong></p><p>Pre-adoptive Home Studies of wards or former wards, conducted for the certification process of adoptive families, now require caseworkers to interview at the minimum three child and professional collaterals, especially school personnel to objectively ensure the accuracy of the information being provided.&nbsp;</p><p>Caseworker doing the home study should interview at least three other persons as collaterals. &nbsp;These collaterals should have contact with the child and/or family, knowledge regarding any special needs of the child and be able to comment on the foster parent’s interaction and care of the child. &nbsp;These collateral contacts should be interviewed to ascertain that there are no concerns regarding the foster parent’s ability to care for the minor. &nbsp;Should any concerns be noted, then it is the caseworker’s responsibility to address them via services or whatever else is applicable prior to proceeding with the adoption.</p><p><strong>Required collateral contacts may include but are not limited to the following people; (Must have at a minimum 3 collateral contacts.)&nbsp;</strong></p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Teacher/School Personnel/Day Care Provider/0 to 3 provider (one is mandatory depending on the child’s age);&nbsp;</li><li>Licensing worker (Mandatory if Licensed Provider);&nbsp;</li><li>Medical professional or service provider; or</li><li>Other person who has regular contact with the child&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>IV.

PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>Primary users of this Policy Guide are staff of the Department and Purchase of Service (POS) that are responsible for placing children for whom the Department is legally responsible in substitute care and/or DCFS and POS staff that assist with completing and/or submitting the appropriate form when a child is initially placed, when a child is absent from her/his placement, or when a child returns to her/his placement after an absence, and when a child’s placement is changed.</p><p><strong>III. USE OF THE CFS 906/E and CFS 906-1/E FORMS</strong></p><p>Department policy requires that a CFS 906 or CFS 906-1, Placement/Payment Authorization Form (hereinafter referred to generally as the CFS 906 form) be completed and submitted to CAPU every time a child’s placement is made, interrupted by a temporary absence, changed, or terminated, and to authorize payment to foster parents, group homes, POS agencies, institutions, and/or independent clients. (See Department Administrative Procedure #5, Child Welfare Case Record Organization and Uniform Recording Requirements, Appendix D, CYCIS Forms Instructions for details.)</p><p>As stated in Section I of this Policy Guide, the new CFS 906/E and CFS 906-1/E forms may be submitted via e-mail in lieu of submitting the hard copy CFS 906 or CFS 906-1 form by fax to CAPU or, only when applicable, to the Department’s Central Payment Unit in Springfield. However, the CFS 906/E and CFS 906-1/E <strong>must always be used in combination with a hard copy of the CFS 906 or CFS 906-1 form.</strong> This requirement is due to the fact that the hard copy CFS 906 and CFS 906-1 form has a pre-printed “Form Sequence Number” in the upper right hand corner of the form. The “Form Sequence Number” is the control number the Department uses to track placement and payment transactions submitted to CAPU or the CPU. The “Form Sequence Number” from a hard copy of the CFS 906 or CFS 906-1 must be entered precisely into the ”No.” data field which is located in the upper right hand corner of the of the CFS 906/E or CFS 906-1/E The hard copy of the related CFS 906 or CFS 906-1 form <strong>must be stapled to a printed copy of the related CFS 906/E or CFS 906-1/E form</strong> and filed in a child’s case record. A “Print Form” button is located at the bottom of the CFS 906/E and CFS 906-1/E; it is recommended that the “Print Form” button be used to print the completed CFS 906/E and CFS 906-1/E forms prior to submitting the forms via e-mail.</p><p><strong>IV.

(See Section I above for the list of living arrangement codes to be submitted directly to CPU.)</li><li>When staff clicks on a “submit button” a pre-addressed e-mail will appear to which the completed CFS 906/E or 906-1/E will be automatically attached. Staff shall enter the name of the child and the CYCIS case number to which CFS 906/E or the CFS 906-1/E applies in the body or subject line of the e-mail before it is sent to CAPU or, if applicable, to CPU.</li></ul><p>A <strong>“Print Form”</strong> button was added at the bottom of each form. It is highly recommended that the “Print Form” button be used to print the form after it is completed, but before it is submitted. A printed copy of the completed CFS 906/E or 906-1/E form must be attached to the original hard copy CFS 906 or 906-1 and included in the case file.</p><p><strong>IV.

Accessing the Department’s Secure D-Net</strong></p><p>DCFS staff automatically accesses the secure Intranet when they click on the Internet Explorer icon on their computer.</p><p>Every POS agency which has one or more contracts with the Department to provide substitute care must have a Virtual Private Network (VPN) agreement with the Department before being able to access the Department’s secure Intranet. Additionally, each staff person of a POS agency that will be accessing, completing, and submitting a CFS 906-1/E form must also have an “NT Account” within the DCFS secure computer Intranet. An “NT Account” is, in essence, a Department issued state of Illinois e-mail address that ends with “@Illinois.gov.”</p><p><strong>VI. Accessing the CFS 906/E and CFS 906-1/E Forms</strong></p><p>The CFS 906/E and CFS 906-1/E forms are available to Department and POS agency staff on the secure D-Net. The CFS 906/E and CFS 906-1/E are located in two different locations:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>On the Network Drives in a “906 - E Templates folder (DCFS, only); and the</li><li>D-Net / Rules and Procedures / DCFS Web Resource site link</li></ul><p>To access forms on the Network Drives (DCFS, only),</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Click on the “My Computer” icon; then</li><li>Click on the “Templates” icon; then</li><li>Click on the “906-E” folder; then</li><li>Click on the CFS 906/E (DCFS staff only) or the CFS 906-1/E (POS staff only) form and the selected form will open.</li></ul><p>To access forms on the D-Net / Rules and Procedures / DCFS Web Resource site link;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>DCFS staff should click on the Internet Explorer icon on their computer and POS staff should click on the Internet Explorer icon on their computer after accessing the Virtual Private Network;</li><li>Under “D-Net Links,” click on the Rules and Procedures / DCFS Web Resource site link;</li><li>Click on “CFS Forms”;</li><li>DCFS staff should click on the CFS 906/E form and POS staff should click on the CFS 906-1/E form. The form will open.</li></ul><p><strong>VII. Submitting the Forms</strong></p><p>The completed CFS 906/E or 906-1/E may be submitted via e-mail by clicking the appropriate “Submit” button:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Submit <strong>“Case Opening ONLY”</strong>: to be used ONLY when submitting a 906/E or 906-1/Es to open a case to CAPU in Chicago;</li><li>Submit to <strong>“CAPU Cook”</strong>: to be used by DCFS and POS staff with a Cook county R/S/F team number to submit ONLY 906/E or 906-1/Es to CAPU in Chicago;</li><li>Submit to <strong>“CAPU Downstate”</strong>: to be used by DCFS and POS staff with a downstate R/S/F team number to submit ONLY 906/E or 906-1/Es to CAPU in Chicago; and</li><li>Submit to <strong>“Payment Unit”</strong> to be used ONLY for the limited number of 906/E or 906-1/Es which by Department policy are to submitted directly to the Central Payment Unit in Springfield.</li></ul><p>When staff clicks on a submit button a pre-addressed e-mail will appear to which the 906/E or 906-1/Es will be automatically attached. The case name and number should be entered in the “subject” and/or body of the e-mail, before the Department or POS staff “sends” out the e-mail.</p><p><strong>VIII. Printing and Saving Completed Forms</strong></p><p>The CFS 906/E and the CFS 906-1/E forms are printable using the “Print Form” button at the bottom of each form.</p><p><strong>Each CFS 906/E and CFS 906-1/E submitted by secure e-mail will automatically be “saved” to the “Sent” folder of the user’s e-mail.</strong> The DCFS or POS staff that submitted the e-mail should print a copy of the e-mail, a copy of the attached CFS 906/E or CFS 906-1/E (using the “Print Form button) and, if applicable, a copy of any other document that was attached to the e-mail. A copy of all printed documents <strong>plus</strong> a copy of the hard copy CFS 906 or CFS 906-1 from which the “Form Sequence Number” was transposed into the CFS 906/E or CFS 906-1/E must be filed in the child’s case record.</p><p>It is highly recommended that Department and POS staff create a “906-E” or “906-1-E” electronic folder and “file”/save all 906/E or 906-1/E related e-mails in it.</p><p><strong>IX.

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to implement an Office of the Inspector General recommendation requiring caseworkers to complete the new <strong>CFS 1800-U</strong>, 60+ Subsidy Checklist form for each child when his/her prospective guardians or adoptive caregivers are age 60 and older.</p><p>This Policy Guide also issues the new<strong> CFS 486-G</strong>, Subsidized Guardianship Conversion Assessment form, which must be completed by the caseworker prior to submitting the guardianship subsidy packet to the Adoption Coordinator/Liaison for approval.</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>Primary users of this Policy Guide are Statewide Adoption Coordinators, Adoption Coordinators/Liaisons, their staff, and DCFS and Private Agency Child Welfare Staff, and Supervisors.</p><p><strong>III. PROCEDURES</strong></p><p>The completed <strong>CFS 1800-U</strong>, 60+ Subsidy Checklist form will be reviewed in detail at the Child and Family Team Meeting in conjunction with the assigned Adoption Liaison/Coordinator (in person or by phone), the prospective guardians or adoptive caregivers, and the back-up caregiver (in person or by phone). During the meeting, the Child and Family Team shall discuss the back-up caregiver’s role and responsibilities for the child, confirmation that the back-up caregiver is prepared to assume their future role as the caregiver, and determine whether additional permanency planning is necessary. If additional permanency planning is necessary, the family will be referred to the Child Protection Mediation Program (in Cook County), or to Metropolitan Family Services Older Caregiver Program (in Cook County), or to additional planning or services. If no additional permanency planning is required, the assigned DCFS Adoption Liaison/Coordinator signs the completed <strong>CFS 1800-U</strong> reflecting agreement with the planning. The original signed <strong>CFS 1800-U</strong> shall be maintained in each child’s file.</p><p>Caseworkers are also required to complete the <strong>CFS 486-G</strong>, Subsidized Guardianship Conversion Assessment form prior to submitting the Guardianship subsidy packet to the Adoption Coordinator/Liaison for approval. The information included in the <strong>CFS 486-G</strong> assists the worker and the agency in determining whether the prospective guardian(s) can meet the needs of the child. The <strong>CFS 486-G</strong> is an assessment tool that documents the family’s preparation and also assists in identifying any possible issues or problems with the family’s conversion from foster care to guardianship.</p><p><strong>IV. ATTACHMENTS</strong></p><p><strong>CFS 1800-U, 60+Subsidy Checklist Form</strong><br><strong>CFS 486-G, Subsidized Guardianship Conversion Assessment Form</strong></p><p><strong>V.

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to implement the transition from Child and Youth Investment Team (CAYIT) to Clinical Intervention for Placement Preservation (CIPP) in Department Policy and to issue instructions to Department staff regarding the CIPP referral, staffing and follow-up process. This Policy Guide replaces Policy Guide 2010.01, Child and Youth Investment Teams.</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>Primary users of this Policy Guide are DCFS and Private Agency Child Welfare Staff and Supervisors.</p><p><strong>III. BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>This Policy Guide introduces the Clinical Division’s new placement stabilization and preservation program, Clinical Intervention for Placement Preservation (CIPP) which recently replaced the Child and Youth Investment Team (CAYIT). This program is designed to have greater emphasis on earlier interventions to improve placement stabilization by preserving youth and family social connections and relationships and minimizing changes in placement. The goal is to reduce the amount of changes in living arrangements and to prevent entry into residential and group home settings.</p><p><strong>IV. CLINICAL INTERVENTION FOR PLACEMENT PRESERVATION</strong></p><p>Clinical Intervention for Placement Preservation (CIPP) is a facilitator-guided, team decision-making process to improve placement preservation and increase placement stability. A CIPP staffing is conducted to determine the array and intensity of services needed for a child or youth whose current placement is threatened with disruption or whose care cannot be provided for in his/her current placement. A CIPP staffing is also conducted to determine the array and intensity of services needed for a child or youth whose placement has disrupted.</p><p>In a CIPP staffing, the caseworker brings together key people in the child/youth’s life, with the assistance and support of a trained facilitator who leads a discussion sensitive to the individual needs, motivation and capabilities of the child/youth. Participants are encouraged to offer their assessment of the child/youth’s wishes, needs and strengths and to generate ideas on how those wishes, needs and strengths can be best addressed, ideally in the child/youth’s current placement.</p><p>When the services needed cannot be provided in the current placement, staffing participants will determine the setting best suited to meet the child/youth’s individual needs. In these situations, matching the child/youth with placement resources that can meet the identified needs will be initiated by members of the Centralized Matching Team during the staffing, whenever possible. Additionally, caregivers will be encouraged to participate in the child/youth’s treatment and to remain a placement and/or visiting resource for the youth when residential/group home care and/or a transitional living or independent living program is warranted.</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li><p><strong>Population Served by CIPP</strong></p><p>A CIPP staffing is recommended for any child or youth at risk of placement disruption from his/her current caregiver in a traditional or specialized foster family home placement, a home of relative placement, or a transitional living program (TLP). According to national research, cases at highest risk for placement disruption involve children/youth with a history of recent police involvement, frequent school truancy, runaway behaviors and/or untreated psychiatric disorders.</p></li><li><p><strong>CIPP Objectives</strong></p><p>The goals of CIPP are to:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Improve placement preservation and increase placement stability by:<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li>Reducing the number of unplanned placement changes;</li><li>Diverting entry into residential or group home settings unless clinically indicated as a treatment intervention; and</li><li>Ensuring that the child/youth’s connections to family, community and social supports, including his/her caregiver, are maintained when a change of placement is required.</li></ol></li><li>Improve the child/youth’s well-being and functioning by building and maintaining connections to family, social supports and community.</li><li><p>Improve access to and use of community-based supports including the involvement of DCFS System of Care (SOC) services.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> A CIPP referral is not required to access or use SOC services.</p></li><li>Improve the timeliness of interventions prior to placement disruption.</li></ol></li><li><p><strong>CIPP Participants</strong></p><p>The core participants of a CIPP meeting include:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Required participants<ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>the caseworker;</li><li>the casework supervisor;</li><li>the youth ( age 12 or older), unless clinically contraindicated; and</li><li>the current caregiver.</li></ul></li><li><p>Additional participants recommended</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>family members;</li><li>the GAL</li><li>the CASA worker;</li><li>youth-identified supports/advocates; and</li><li>a member of the Centralized Matching Team (CMT) or SOC provider.</li></ul><p>Others who may be invited to a CIPP staffing include, but are not limited to, former caregivers, Clinical Specialty Consultants, school staff, members of the Child and Family Team, the child/youth’s or family’s therapist, the Foster Parent Support Specialist, DCFS Permanency Specialist, DCFS Foster Care Recruitment and Development Specialist, DCFS Dually-Involved Specialist, DCFS Consulting Psychologist, DCFS Regional Nurse, and/or Educational Liaison.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>CIPP Process</strong></p><p>CIPP uses a consensus-based decision-making process to help participants determine the array and intensity of supports and services needed to maintain a child or youth in his/her current placement or when a change in placement is required. CIPP ensures that child/youth-identified supports and SOC involvement are incorporated into the process to help identify the child/youth’s strengths and to provide and/or expedite timely access of community resources.</p><p>The <strong>CFS 1452-1, CIPP Referral Form</strong> is the CIPP referral document. The <strong>CFS 1452-1</strong> serves as the basis for the staffing discussion and exploration of the child/youth’s service needs. Prior to the CIPP meeting, CIPP Intake and the CIPP Facilitator shall assist the caseworker in reaching out to and preparing all non-professional participants (caregiver, child/youth, family and other supportive adults) on the expectations of the CIPP team decision meeting.</p><p>The <strong>CFS 1452-2, CIPP Action Plan</strong> developed during the CIPP meeting shall focus on the top 2-3 concerns identified during the meeting. The <strong>CFS 1452-2</strong> shall be drafted by the caseworker and distributed to all staffing participants at the conclusion of the CIPP meeting. The casework supervisor shall monitor and ensure implementation of all tasks identified in the <strong>CFS 1452-2</strong> within 30 days of the CIPP meeting. The caseworker and supervisor shall review the <strong>CFS 1452-2</strong> in ongoing casework supervision, and the supervisor shall document that review in supervisory note. The caseworker shall invite the CIPP participants to ongoing Child and Family Team Meetings to review implementation of the <strong>CFS 1452-2</strong>, and the <strong>CFS 1452-2</strong> shall be reviewed at each Administrative Case Review.</p><p>When the current caregiver or child/youth age 12 or older is not able to attend the CIPP meeting by phone or in person, the CIPP meeting and <strong>CFS 1452-2</strong> shall address urgent safety needs and include steps to be taken to engage the absent required participants in future meetings. Decisions involving placement changes for an absent child/youth shall only be considered when CIPP staff verify (prior to the meeting) the child/youth or caregiver’s refusal to participate in the meeting. In these situations, the <strong>CFS 1452-2</strong> shall address steps needed to communicate with and engage the caregiver and/or youth when a placement move is pending.</p><p>When a child/youth age 12 or older is unable to participate in the CIPP staffing either in-person or by phone, the caseworker shall ensure that the youth receives a copy of the <strong>CFS 1452-2</strong> within 7 business days.</p></li><li><p><strong>When a CIPP Is Required</strong></p><p>A referral for a CIPP staffing is required when:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>A change in caregiver or living arrangement is being considered by a caseworker or caregiver for a child/youth in a traditional, home of relative or specialized foster family home placement due to difficulties associated with the child/youth’s behavioral and/or emotional needs. This includes a child/youth being considered for:<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li>A specialized foster care placement, including a lateral move with change in home needed or designation of status in the same home as “specialized”;</li><li>Treatment in a residential facility or group home; or</li><li>A Transitional Living Program (TLP);</li></ol></li><li>A youth and/or caseworker is seeking an initial or ongoing Placement Alternative Contract (PAC); or</li><li>A child/youth is residing in a temporary living arrangement (e.g., a shelter, detention facility or DOC facility) without an identified placement.</li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> This does not include children/youth who are currently hospitalized in psychiatric facilities without an identified discharge placement. These cases are reviewed by Regional Clinical Staff.</p></li><li><p><strong>When a CIPP Staffing Is Not Required</strong></p><p>A CIPP is not required for cases:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Involving a planned change in placement that complies with policy (e.g., placement with siblings, removal from an unsafe living arrangement, etc.);</li><li>Involving an emergency request from the field for specialized foster care services for a child/youth new to care (e.g., in protective custody or who has been in placement for fewer than 45 days) and written confirmation of the need for such services is not yet available. These referrals should continue to be requested by sending a <strong>CFS 418-J, Checklist for Children at Initial Placement</strong> to the DCFS Specialized Foster Care Unit at “Spec FosterCare” via DCFS Outlook email. When agreement cannot be reached, the Specialized Foster Care Unit may refer the case for a CIPP staffing.</li><li>Involving a request for the Independent Living Program (ILO) for a youth meeting the referral criteria established in <strong>Procedures 302, App. H</strong>.</li><li>Involving lateral moves or step-ups within TLP, residential, group home, or ILO.</li><li>Involving a request for a CILA, MI-TLP or DD-TLP.</li><li>Seeking SOC services.</li><li>Seeking a Clinical Consult with DCFS Specialty Services or the Regional Clinical staff.</li><li>Seeking a psychological, parenting or neuropsychological assessment.</li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> Requests for an ILO living arrangement will be initiated by completing the <strong>CFS 1452-1</strong> and submitting it to CIPP Intake. CIPP Intake shall forward the <strong>CFS 1452-1 </strong>directly to the Centralized Matching Team for matching to providers, bypassing the need for a CIPP meeting. Casework supervisors and ILO program providers shall ensure that referrals to independent living programs adhere to <strong>Procedures 301.60(e), Transitional and Independent Living Program Services</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Referrals</strong></p><p>The caseworker or current caregiver can call CIPP Intake to swiftly schedule a meeting. When receiving a call from a caregiver, CIPP Intake shall contact the caseworker prior to scheduling a meeting.</p><p>CIPP shall accept referrals from caregiver only for purposes of identifying services and supports needed to preserve the current placement. CIPP does not replace the existing procedures for accessing SOC, SASS, a Clinical Placement Review or the Advocacy Office for Children and Families. CIPP Intake shall redirect requests for placement changes and/or concerns to the assigned caseworker and supervisor for follow-up.</p><p>When requesting a CIPP meeting, the caseworker shall contact CIPP Intake by phone at 312-814-6800 or by DCFS Outlook email at “CIPP Intake”. The caseworker shall complete the <strong>CFS 1452-1</strong> prior to scheduling a CIPP. When possible and if needed, CIPP Intake can assist the caseworker in completing the <strong>CFS 1452-1</strong> via phone. All efforts will be made to schedule CIPP meetings at times and locations that will support involvement by the child/youth, his/her family and caregiver, and minimize school disruptions.</p><p><strong>Note: The CFS 1452-1, CIPP Referral Form; CFS 1452-2, CIPP Action Plan; and CFS 1452-3, CIPP Referral Packet Documentation Checklist replace all CAYIT forms and CMT electronic documents.</strong></p><p>After receiving a CIPP referral, CIPP Intake and the assigned Facilitator shall collaborate with the caseworker to invite and prepare participants for the upcoming meeting. Caseworkers should continue their efforts to discuss the upcoming CIPP meeting with the youth, caregiver and youth’s family.</p><p>When the referral process is complete, the CIPP Intake Coordinator shall send written confirmation of the date, time and meeting location via email to the caseworker/supervisor, CIPP Facilitator and other participants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Matching</strong></p><p>A member of the Centralized Matching Team (CMT) will participate in CIPP staffings in person or by telephone, whenever possible, when a child/youth’s individual needs appear to require more intensive services than those available in the current placement and/or require placement in a residential facility or group home, or a treatment or transitional living program.</p><p>CMT shall initiate the matching process during the CIPP meeting. The caseworker shall document identified matches the <strong>CFS 1452-2</strong>. The caseworker shall prepare and send out a referral packet to each matched provider within 24 hours after the CIPP meeting. Each packet shall contain all the items marked as \"Attached\" on the <strong>CFS 1452-3, CIPP Referral Packet Documentation Checklist</strong>.</p><p>When a CMT staff person cannot attend the CIPP meeting, the CIPP Facilitator shall provide CMT with the updated <strong>CFS 1452-1</strong> and <strong>CFS 1452-2</strong> within one business day of the CIPP meeting. CMT will provide matches to the caseworker via email within three business days of receiving the <strong>CFS 1452-1</strong> and <strong>CFS 1452-2</strong> from the CIPP Facilitator. Using the <strong>CFS 1452-3</strong> for guidance, the caseworker shall prepare and send out referral packets to the identified providers within 24 hours of receiving the list of matched providers from CMT.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Providers will not interview a child or youth without receipt of the complete referral packet and documentation, as specified on the <strong>CFS 1452-3 CIPP Referral Packet Documentation Checklist</strong>.</p><p>CMT staff shall continue to notify the caseworker and providers by email of any other potential matches following the CIPP meeting. The caseworker and supervisor shall check their email daily for correspondence from CMT to expedite placement and address any barriers that may arise.</p><p>Form CFS 1455 is now obsolete.</p></li></ol><p><strong>V.

Specifically, hotline staff must determine whether the information provided by the reporter indicates that agency environment and conditions expose a child or adult resident to harm, risk of harm or a lack of necessary care, including but not limited to, adequate supervision, food, clothing and shelter and that the harm the child or adult resident has been subjected to is injurious to the extent agency staff culpability is mitigated by systemic problems, such as inadequate staffing, management, training or supervision. Also included in this allegation are incidents of harm when the perpetrator cannot be identified.</p><p>Hotline staff should evaluate the caller’s information for applicable Circumstances and Factors To Be Considered, as set forth in DCFS Rule and Procedure. Reports that include <strong>Allegation #86</strong> shall be processed, completed and transmitted according to current procedures.</p><p><strong>Child Protection</strong></p><p>Once a Child Protection Specialist determines a report that includes <strong>Allegation #86</strong> was made in good faith, the Child Protection Specialist shall continue the investigation by applying the criteria and fulfilling the requirements of the allegation, as well as current investigatory procedures and practice, in order to reach a final finding determination.</p><p><strong>Allegation of Harm #86</strong><br><strong>NEGLECT BY AGENCY</strong></p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Neglect by Agency</strong></p><p>Neglect by Agency means the failure of an agency to implement practices that ensure the health, physical well-being or welfare of the children or adult residents residing in the facility, and/or there are conditions at the agency that expose children or adult residents to harm, risk of harm or a lack of other necessary care, including but not limited to, adequate supervision, food, clothing and shelter; or a child or adult resident is subjected to an environment that is injurious to the extent staff culpability for abuse or neglect is mitigated by systemic problems, such as inadequate staffing, management, training or supervision of staff; and/or an incident of abuse or neglect against a child or adult resident where the perpetrator of such harm cannot be identified.</p></li><li><strong>Taking a Report</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>A service recipient/youth has been exposed to harm or risk of harm due to the blatant disregard of caregiver responsibilities by the agency responsible for the youth’s welfare.

The supervisory consultation must be documented in a supervisory note.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>Child Protection and Licensing Concurrent Investigations</strong><br><strong>The Child Protection Specialist shall immediately notify the local DCFS Licensing Representative of the investigation.</strong> A concurrent licensing complaint investigation shall be performed for all Department and private agency foster homes, day care homes and all other licensed facilities named in reports of alleged incidents of abuse or neglect. For all reports that include <strong>Allegation #86</strong>, current practice and procedures apply for conducting concurrent Child Protection and Licensing investigations. For instruction and information concerning concurrent Child Protection and Licensing investigations, staff should reference <strong>Procedures 300.110, Special Types of Reports</strong> and <strong>Procedures 383.37, Additional Requirements for Concurrent Investigations.</strong></p><p><strong>Licensing/Monitoring</strong></p><p>For a report with an indicated <strong>Allegation #86, Neglect by Agency</strong>, DCFS Licensing shall apply the current practice and procedure for requiring the indicated facility to develop and implement a Corrective Plan for the agency conditions that led to the indicated report and violation of licensing standards. The Corrective Plan shall identify any systemic problem that led to the indicated final finding determination and include suggested corrective measures.</p><p>Corrective Plans must be approved by the Licensing Supervisor and monitored by the Licensing Representative. In reviewing the continued qualifications of a facility for an operating license, the Department shall evaluate the facility’s compliance with any Corrective Plan resulting from an indicated report or licensing investigation and take appropriate enforcement action for repeated failure to correct identified problems, in accordance with applicable state law and regulation. Such enforcement action may include, but not be limited to, revoking a license; refusing to renew a license; or refusing to issue a full license, subsequent to a permit. All licensees and permit holders are afforded due process rights through AHU for any action taken.</p><p><strong>Administrative Hearings</strong></p><p>An individual or agency that has been indicated as a perpetrator and who has received notice of the indicated final finding determination made against them has the right to challenge the decision by requesting an appeal of the indicated finding.</p><p>To begin the appeal process, the perpetrator or appropriate officer/administrator/owner of the agency shall request in writing on the form provided that the Department review its decision. The request must be mailed or faxed to the address or fax number designated in the written notice within 60 days after notification of the completion of the investigation, as determined by the date of the notification sent by the Department.</p><p><strong>Special Note:</strong> It is possible for an appellant/agency to have concurrent hearings to appeal a licensing enforcement action and an indicated report for child abuse or neglect. When common issues of fact or law are raised in more than one appeal, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may consolidate the appeals into a single group hearing.</p><p><strong>VI.

PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>The primary users of this Policy Guide are DCFS and POS Permanency Supervisors and Caseworkers; DCFS and POS Foster Care Licensing Representatives and Supervisors, A&amp;I Licensing Representatives and Supervisors, Child Welfare Agency, Child Care Institution and Group Home Administrators, Supervisors and Staff. &nbsp;This Policy Guide may impact Child Protection Specialists and Supervisors when there is any delay in assignment of a Permanency Worker for a child or youth in Protective or Temporary Custody.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III. DEFINITIONS &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>“Normalcy parenting”</strong> means empowering a caregiver to approve or not approve a child’s or youth’s participation in appropriate extracurricular activities based on the caregiver’s own assessment using the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard, without prior approval of the Department, the Permanency Worker or the court. &nbsp;The goal of Normalcy Parenting and the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard is to allow children and youth in care the opportunity for normal growth and development through participation in age, physical, culturally and mentally appropriate activities, responsibilities and life skills.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard” </strong>means the standard characterized by careful and sensible parental decisions that maintain the health, safety, and best interests of a child while at the same time encouraging the emotional and developmental growth of the child, that a caregiver shall use when determining whether to allow a child in foster care under the responsibility of the State to participate in extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities. [42 U.S.C. 675(10)]&nbsp;</p><p>The caregiver must use the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard when determining whether to allow a child in care to participate in extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Caregiver”</strong> means a licensed foster parent or unlicensed relative caregiver who provides care for a child in DCFS custody or guardianship, or a designated official employed by and present at the licensed child care facility in which a child in DCFS custody or guardianship is placed. &nbsp;For purposes of this Policy Guide, the “caregiver” for a youth under 18 years of age in an independent living (ILO) or transitional living (TLP) arrangement is assigned or designated staff of the ILO or TLP provider/child care facility.</p><p><strong>\"Appropriate activities\"</strong> means activities or items that are generally accepted as suitable for children of the same chronological age or developmental level of maturity. &nbsp;Appropriateness is based on the development of cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral capacity that is typical for an age or age group, taking into account the individual child's cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral development. &nbsp;[20 ILCS 505/7.3a]&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IV. GENERAL PRINCIPLES</strong></p><p>Effective immediately, ALL caregivers for all children/youth in out of home placements licensed by the Department should use Normalcy Parenting and the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard for decision-making regarding the children/youth’s participation in:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>extracurricular activities;&nbsp;</li><li>enrichment opportunities;&nbsp;</li><li>social activities; and&nbsp;</li><li>cultural activities, religious, and other significant activities.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Normalcy parenting empowers caregivers to make these decisions without seeking approval or consent from the Permanency Worker or other child welfare staff.</p><p>The caregiver must still seek consent in other areas where specific State or federal laws limit consent authorization. &nbsp;Some examples where Normalcy Parenting does not apply include to consent to medical and dental care, and disclosure of mental health information.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Appendix A</strong> lists frequent events affecting the lives of children and youth in care, and the persons authorize to give consent for those events. &nbsp;Appendix A includes the categories of events where, under normalcy parenting, the caregiver is authorized to consent. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Appendix A is not intended to be exhaustive, since it is impossible to predict every potential event that may arise in a child’s lives. &nbsp;If an event is not listed in Appendix A, the caregiver should consult with the Permanency Worker. &nbsp;If necessary, the Permanency Worker or Supervisor can consult with the Office of the DCFS Guardian.&nbsp;</p><p>Section 7.3a of the Child and Family Services Act lists 5 factors (a through e, below) that caregivers should consider as they apply the Reasonable and Prudent Parent Standard. &nbsp;Under each factor are a few questions that may help the caregiver in this process.&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li>The child’s age, maturity, and developmental level to promote the overall health, safety, and best interests of the child.&nbsp;<ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Is my decision based on my child’s individual needs and abilities?

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to issue revised procedures for private agencies to follow when requesting reimbursement for Council on Accreditation of Services for Families and Children (COA) accreditation costs. This Policy Guide replaces Policy Guide 2000.10.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>The primary users of this Policy Guide are Quality Assurance, Contract Administration, Agency Performance, Purchase of Service (POS) Monitoring, Business Office and Administrative Service staff of the Department and purchase of service agencies with foster care contracts (traditional, relative, specialized and treatment).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III. BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p><p>Due to the Department’s standard that all child welfare agencies providing foster care must be accredited DCFS agreed to reimburse COA accreditation costs to child welfare agencies providing foster care that became accredited or were reaccredited on or after July 1, 1999. &nbsp;The Department has since expanded the reimbursement process to child welfare agencies providing foster care services and/or Intact Family Services (IFS) on or after July 1, 2016. &nbsp;</p><p>If a private agency has another program(s) accredited by either the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) or the Commission for Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), the private agency can pursue accreditation of their foster care and/or IFS programs(s) through that same accrediting agency without DCFS reimbursement. &nbsp;<strong>However, DCFS will ONLY reimburse COA accreditation/reaccreditation costs. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>IV. ACCREDITATION/REACCREDITATION REIMBURSEMENT PROTOCOL</strong></p><p>DCFS reimburses the cost of accreditation surveys conducted by the Council on Accreditation (COA) up to the limits in the schedule of accreditation costs provided by COA.</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>DCFS will reimburse a private agency for the costs of accreditation AFTER the private agency has received accreditation certification from the COA. &nbsp;The effective month/year of the accreditation must be on or after July 2016 for agencies providing foster care services only, IFS services only or a combination of foster care and IFS. &nbsp;Accreditation costs refer to the application fee, accreditation fee (financial agreement with COA) and the site visit charge.&nbsp;</li><li>After the agency has become accredited, the agency may submit a request for reimbursement of accreditation costs. &nbsp;The request should be in the form of a written letter to DCFS with a copy of the accreditation certification letter from COA and a copy of the billing from COA. &nbsp;DCFS will review the request to ensure the appropriate documentation is attached and that the costs fall within the COA schedule of accreditation costs.&nbsp;</li><li><p>Requests for reimbursement should be submitted to:&nbsp;</p><p>Manager &nbsp;<br>DCFS Office of Contract Administration &nbsp;<br>406 East Monroe, Station #455 &nbsp;<br>Springfield, Illinois 62701&nbsp;</p></li><li>Reimbursement for the accreditation survey costs will be paid under <strong>Type Service Code (TSC) 0134 - </strong><em><strong>Accreditation Survey Costs Reimbursement. &nbsp;</strong></em></li><li>DCFS will also reimburse the private agency for the COA application fee, accreditation fee (financial agreement with COA) and the site visit charge if the private agency is a provisional or full member of the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) and CWLA reimburses the private agency or pays these costs on behalf of the private agency. &nbsp;The private agency must submit to DCFS the COA invoice paid by CWLA on behalf of the agency along with the COA accreditation certification letter.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>V. REIMBURSEMENT FOR SITE PREPARATORY AND CORRECTIVE ACTION COSTS</strong></p><p>DCFS will provide reimbursement for preparatory costs and the costs of correcting deficient standards identified in a COA accreditation survey, <strong>up to a maximum amount equal to the total of the application fee, accreditation fee and site visit costs.</strong> &nbsp;For example:&nbsp;</p><p>If the application fee is $600, the accreditation fee is $9,400 and the site visit costs are $4,800, DCFS will reimburse the private agency $14,800 under <strong>TSC 0134.&nbsp;</strong> The ceiling for matching preparatory and corrective action costs would then be $14,800. &nbsp;</p><p>To receive reimbursement for corrective action costs, the private agency must submit:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>the original accreditation survey findings; &nbsp;</li><li>the private agency’s corrective action plan; &nbsp;</li><li>documentation (i.e., invoices, etc.) to support the costs incurred; and &nbsp;</li><li>a copy of the COA accreditation certification letter. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>For site preparatory costs, appropriate documentation to support the costs incurred plus proof of accreditation are required. &nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Providers need to clearly distinguish between reimbursements for survey costs versus reimbursement for corrective action or site preparatory costs.</li></ul><p><strong>NOTE: Reimbursement for preparatory and corrective action costs will only be made AFTER the agency has been accredited by COA. &nbsp;</strong></p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li><p>Requests for reimbursement must be submitted in writing to: &nbsp;</p><p>Manager &nbsp;<br>DCFS Office of Contract Administration &nbsp;<br>406 East Monroe, Station #455 &nbsp;<br>Springfield, Illinois 62701 &nbsp;</p></li><li>Reimbursement for site preparatory and corrective action costs will be paid under <strong>TSC 0135 – </strong><em><strong>Accreditation Corrective Action Costs Reimbursement.</strong></em>&nbsp;</li><li>Corrective action and site preparatory costs are defined as one-time nonrecurring costs. On-going salary costs will not be considered.</li></ul><p>DCFS will NOT reimburse a private agency for any penalties imposed by COA or for any of the costs associated with remedial visits. &nbsp;Remedial visits are follow up site visits required because of significant agency deficiencies. &nbsp;</p><p>DCFS will not reimburse the cost of any penalties imposed on the private agency as a result of the accreditation process. &nbsp;DCFS will not reimburse the annual maintenance fee for accreditation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>VI.

The Department shall notify the prospective adoptive parents of the availability and the types of assistance. The adoptive parent may refuse any or all of the adoption assistance. The ongoing monthly payment shall be issued to the person identified in the adoption assistance agreement. &nbsp;Any type of adoption assistance services included in this Part that are payable through insurance or other funding sources will not be paid by the Department. The child adopted with adoption assistance is entitled to receive only those services and/or payments specified in the adoption assistance agreement.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Responsibility of the State in Interjurisdictional Adoptions<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li>When the Department has responsibility for placement and care of a child who is eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement, the Department is responsible for entering into the adoption assistance agreement and paying the adoption subsidy, even if the child is placed in an adoptive home in another state.&nbsp;</li><li>If the Department does not have responsibility for placement and care of a Title IV-E eligible child, it is the adoptive parent's state of residence where the adoption assistance application should be made. In that event, the public child welfare agency in the adoptive parent’s state of residence is responsible for determining whether the Title IV-E child meets the definition of special needs, entering into the adoption assistance agreement and paying the subsidy, consistent with the way public benefits are paid in other programs.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Continued Eligibility of Children<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li>If an adoption is dissolved because of the termination of parental rights, or the death of the adoptive parents, a child adopted with Title IV-E adoption assistance continues to be eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance if the State determines that the child meets the definition of a child with special needs prior to finalization of adoption. &nbsp;</li><li>When an adoption assistance agreement is terminated because of the death of the adoptive parents, or the termination of parental rights and the child is adopted again, the Title IV-E child's state of residence is responsible for entering into the assistance agreement and paying the subsidy, consistent with the way public benefits are paid in other programs.&nbsp;</li><li>A child who was previously adopted with adoption assistance and whose adoption dissolves or whose adoptive parents die may be treated as if the financial circumstances for a subsequent adoption are the same as the first time the child was adopted.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p>Eligibility for Adoption Assistance&nbsp;</p><p>Children who are under the Department's legal responsibility and those who are not under the Department's legal responsibility when the adoption petition is filed are eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance when they meet one of the eligibility criteria described in this subsection (b)(1) and the special needs criteria detailed in subsection (b)(2). &nbsp;Children for whom the Department of Children and Family Services is responsible for placement and care when the adoption petition is filed who do not meet the eligibility requirements in this subsection (b)(1) but do meet the special needs criteria detailed in subsection (b)(2) are eligible for State-funded adoption assistance. &nbsp;Children not under the legal responsibility of the Department who do not meet the eligibility criteria described in this subsection (b)(1) but who meet the definition of a child with special needs are eligible for adoption assistance non-recurring expenses only. &nbsp;The Department will not disqualify a child who is otherwise eligible for adoption assistance based on the child being an alien child. &nbsp;A qualified alien child must meet the provisions of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) (P.L. 104-193, 110 Stat. 2168), as amended by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) (P.L. 104-208), and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) (P.L. 105-33, 8 USC 1642).&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>The child was eligible for AFDC under the provisions of Title IV-A of the Social Security Act in effect as of July 16, 1996 during the month the petition was filed to remove the child from the home and the Department has determined that the child meets the definition of a child with special needs;

A licensed relative foster parent caring for a child determined to be eligible for the subsidized guardianship program shall be made aware of the availability of subsidized guardianship and the types of assistance available. &nbsp;The subsidized guardianship agreement must be signed prior to the transfer of guardianship.&nbsp;</p><p>The State funded option of subsidized guardianship provides subsidized guardianship for children for whom the Department has placement and care responsibility and who meet the special needs criteria as defined in section 302.310 (b)(2) of this part, but are not eligible for Title IV-E KinGAP as well as for children who age out of eligibility for Title IV-E KinGAP and continue in school up to the earliest of their nineteenth birthday or graduation from high school, or age 21 when the child meets specific requirements as outlined in this Part.</p></li><li><strong>The Subsidized Guardianship Agreement&nbsp;</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><p>General Provisions</p><p>The type, amount and duration of subsidized guardianship shall be agreed to in writing by the Department and the subsidized guardian prior to the transfer of guardianship and shall be set forth in the subsidized guardianship agreement, which shall be binding on the parties to the agreement. &nbsp;It shall also be stipulated that the agreement shall remain in effect regardless of the state where the subsidized guardian resides currently or in the future and shall contain provisions for the protection of the interests of the child in cases where the subsidized guardian and child move to another state while the agreement is in effect. The amounts of ongoing subsidized guardianship payments are subject to change based on changes in state or federal law regarding adoption assistance payments. Subsidized guardians may refuse any or all payments offered by the Department. &nbsp;The child for whom guardianship is transferred and for whom the guardian is receiving a subsidy shall receive only those services and/or payments specified in the subsidized guardianship agreement. &nbsp;The child may require services in the future that are not currently being provided for pre-existing physical, emotional or mental health needs or risk factors. &nbsp;Any pre-existing conditions must be described in the subsidized guardianship agreement to be eligible for assistance through the Subsidized Guardianship Program at a future date. &nbsp;Assistance cannot be granted for preexisting conditions if the conditions are not listed in the subsidized guardianship agreement in accordance to sub-section (e)(4) of this section or cannot be documented &nbsp;as a pre-existing condition that was unknown at the time of the agreement by a medical provider. &nbsp;The subsidized guardianship agreement must be signed, and a copy of the signed agreement must be provided to the prospective guardian, prior to the transfer of guardianship.</p></li><li><p>Successor of guardianship</p><p>The subsidized guardianship agreement may not be transferred by the guardian(s) to any other party. &nbsp;However, in the event of the death or incapacity of the guardian(s), the child remains eligible for assistance if the guardian(s) has designated a successor guardian(s) in the agreement (or any amendment to the agreement. &nbsp;Upon assuming care of the child, the successor guardian(s) shall contact the Department to inform the Department of changes to the child’s living situation, to request a home study, background checks and to initiate the application process for a subsidy.&nbsp;</p></li></ol></li><li><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Eligibility for Subsidized Guardianship under KinGAP&nbsp;<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li>For a child to qualify for subsidized guardianship under KinGAP, the following criteria must be met:<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman;\" type=\"i\"><li>the child must have been removed from his or her home pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement or as a result of a judicial determination to the effect that continuation in the home would be contrary to the welfare and the best interest of the child;

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to issue the Adoption Timeline in order to guide casework and adoption staff through the critical Permanency process of transitioning, in a timely manner, a child or youth in care who cannot return home, from the foster care system into a lifetime family and home. &nbsp;This timeline offers acceptable timeframes during each step of the way and outlines in chronological order the necessary casework activities to achieve permanency for children in care. &nbsp;Following the termination of parental rights (TPR), parents have sixty days to appeal the TPR decision however; workers must continue to work the case through this period in order to shorten the time that children remain in foster care. &nbsp;Even though guardianship cases follow a slightly different path, this timeline may be used for guardianship cases. &nbsp;Following the formal policy review process The Adoption Timeline will become Appendix A, of Procedures 309, Adoption Services for Children for whom the Department of Children and Family Services is Legally Responsible.</p><p>Attached with this Policy Guide are several forms that have been updated with the help of the Office of Legal Services and Adoption staff, supervisors, and administrators working through a process called “Lean Management,” whose goal is to find ways to streamline the permanency process for youth in care. &nbsp;To that end for Adoptions, the CFS 486 and CFS 411 have been combined and eliminated, and replaced with the CFS 411-A, Report of Investigation for Adoption. &nbsp;The CFS 411-A will be used to create both the Initial Report of Investigation and the Final Report to the Court. &nbsp;For Subsidized Guardianship, the CFS 486-G and the CFS 411 have also been combined and the CFS 411-G shall be used in the same manner as mentioned above.</p><p><strong>II.

BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>Public Act 101-0237 adds Section 7.8 of the Children and Family Services Act [20 ILCS 505/7.8], that adds requirements regarding completion of the home safety checklist, after care services, well-child exams and immunizations in order to ensure the health and safety of youth in care as they are returning home to their parents/guardians.</p><p>Section 7.8 requires:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li><em>Whenever a child is placed in the custody or guardianship of the Department or a child is returned to the custody of a parent or guardian and the court retains jurisdiction of the case, the Department must ensure that the child is up to date on his or her well-child visits, including age-appropriate immunizations, or that there is a documented religious or medical reason the child did not receive the immunizations.</em> [20 ILCS 505/7.8(b)]</li><li>When the court determines that a youth in care can return to the custody of his or her parent/guardian, the Department must complete, prior to the child’s discharge from foster or substitute care, a home safety checklist to ensure that the conditions of the child’s home are sufficient to ensure the child’s safety and well-being. At a minimum, the home safety checklist shall be completed within 24 hours prior to the child’s return home and completed again or recertified within 5 working days after a child is returned home and every month thereafter until the child’s case is closed, pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. [20 ILCS 505/7.8(c)]</li><li>When a court determines that a child should return to the custody or guardianship of a parent or guardian, after care services provided to the child and family shall commence on the date the child is returned to the custody or guardianship of a parent/guardian. If children are returned to the custody or guardianship of a parent or guardian at different times, a minimum of 6 months of after care services shall be provided to each child commencing on the date each individual child is returned home.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR DCFS AND POS PERMANENCY STAFF</strong></p><p>These instructions apply in all placement cases and must be followed prior to and after reunification.</p><p><strong>Procedures 302.360, Health Care Services</strong></p><p>Permanency Workers shall ensure that, prior to reunification, every child in DCFS custody or guardianship:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>is up to date on his/her well-child physical examinations; and</li><li>is immunized according to the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics unless there is a documented religious or medical reason the child did not receive one or more immunizations.</li></ul><p>Permanency Workers shall ensure that each child’s Health Passport contains up to date documentation of the child’s physical examinations and immunizations. Religious or medical reasons for not receiving any one or more immunizations shall be documented on the Health Passport and in case notes.</p><p><strong>Procedures 315, Permanency Planning</strong></p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li>DCFS and POS Permanency Workers are required to provide services to the family <strong>for at least 6 months following return home of each child</strong> from substitute care.</li><li>The Permanency Worker shall perform each of the following duties within the time frames established in this Policy Guide or more frequently when directed by the Permanency Supervisor.<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><p><strong>Develop Reunification and After Care Service Plans for the family.</strong> The Permanency Worker and Permanency Supervisor shall ensure that these Service Plans include the requirement that the Permanency Worker will provide services to the family <strong>for at least 6 months</strong> following return home of <strong>each child</strong>. <strong>The 6-month time period shall begin on the day the child is returned home.</strong></p><p>When more than one child in a family is in substitute care and the children are not returned home on the same day, <strong>the 6-month period shall restart </strong>on the day each additional child is returned home to that parent.</p><p>Example: Child 1 is returned home on March 1. The 6-month period starts March 1. If on April 1, Child 2 is returned home, the 6-month period for the family restarts on April 1. If Child 3 returns home on July 1, the 6-month period for the family restarts on July 1.</p><p>When eligible, the Permanency Worker shall refer the family for Norman and TANF services.</p><p>A Child and Family Team Meeting must be held approximately 30 days prior to reunification and/or case closure to develop the After Care Service Plan (see Procedures 315.125).</p><p>When a court determines a child in substitute care may be returned to the custody of a parent or guardian, the Permanency Worker must complete, <strong>prior to the child’s discharge from foster or substitute care, and within 24 hours prior to the child’s return home, a CFS 2025, Home Safety Checklist</strong> to ensure that the conditions of the child’s home are sufficient to ensure the child’s safety and well-being.</p></li><li><p><strong>Face-To-Face Contact Required with Parents and Each Child.</strong> The required time frames for <strong>face-to-face interventions and contacts</strong> after reunification are set out in (A) through (C), below. Face-to-face contact is required with the parents and each child. The Permanency Worker must see and spend some time with each child outside the presence of the parents.</p><p>The Permanency Worker must document each intervention and contact in a contact note within 48 hours.</p><p>Additionally, a permanency worker must photograph each child and upload the photos to SACWIS immediately prior to returning the child home.</p><p><strong>Each of these required time frames must be met for each child returned home.</strong></p><p>Example: Child 1 returns home on March 1. Child 2 is returned home 3 months later (June 1). The Permanency Worker will be performing all required “First Month” interventions and contacts for Child 2 as well as the “Ongoing” interventions and contacts for Child 1. When Child 2 has been home at least 1 month, the Permanency Worker will perform “Ongoing” interventions and contacts for both children for no less than 6 months of after care contact and services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Initial Intervention and Contact.</strong> Within 24 to 72 hours after the return home of each child from substitute care, the assigned Permanency Worker must conduct an initial face-to-face intervention with each child and the parent in the home. The timing of the visit will be based upon the CERAP completed when each child is returned home. If the family (child and parent) is unavailable, the Permanency Worker must make a second attempt within one working day after the failed attempt. If the second attempt is also unsuccessful, the Permanency Worker shall conduct a diligent search for the family.</p><p>At that visit (no later than within 5 working days after a child is returned home), the Permanency Worker shall also review the <strong>CFS 2025, Home Safety Checklist</strong> completed immediately prior to the child’s return home to ensure that the conditions of the child’s home continue to be sufficient to ensure the child’s safety and well-being. Any changes in the condition of the home shall be documented on the Home Safety Checklist. The Permanency Worker shall document this review in a contact note.</p></li><li><p><strong>First Month.</strong> Following the initial visit, weekly or more frequent intervention and contact, as determined by the Permanency Supervisor, with each child and parent in the home is required for the first month following each child’s reunification. At least two of these visits during this first month after each child’s reunification must be unannounced.</p><p>The Permanency Worker shall also complete a <strong>CFS 2025, Home Safety Checklist</strong> at the end of the first month following each child’s reunification.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ongoing.</strong> After the first month, the frequency of intervention and contact for each child shall be at least monthly. The Permanency Worker shall photograph each child and upload the photos to SACWIS after each monthly visit during the 6 months of after care services. The Permanency Worker shall also complete a <strong>CFS 2025, Home Safety Checklist</strong> at each monthly home visit to ensure that the conditions of the child’s home continue to be sufficient to ensure the child’s safety and well-being.</p><p>When each child returned from substitute care has been home at least 6 months, the Permanency Worker and Permanency Supervisor shall conduct a Risk Assessment to determine whether there are sufficient Risk Factors present to require continued contact. If the Risk Assessment indicates there are no longer sufficient Risk Factors present to warrant ongoing contact and interventions, the Permanency Supervisor may instruct the Permanency Worker to initiate steps to close the case and discontinue contact.</p><p>If a paramour was the indicated perpetrator, the frequency of contact for each child must be weekly for the first three months, regardless of whether or not the paramour resides in the home.</p></li><li><strong>After Care Service Plan and Casework Activities.</strong> The Permanency Worker must comply with all child safety review requirements listed in Procedures 315.250(d), After Care Service Plan and Casework Activities in preparation for case closing. In addition:<ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>the required interviews, photographs, observations and assessments must be conducted of/for <strong>each child</strong>;</li><li>the child safety review must include <strong>a walk-through assessment of the home</strong> as well as completion of the <strong>CFS 2025, Home Safety Checklist</strong>; and</li><li>a completed CANS is required prior to case closing. The CANS is only considered completed when the child items and adult items are scored.</li><li>After the child returns home, while the court case is still open and the court still has jurisdiction, the Permanency Worker must ensure that the child is up to date on their well-child visits and immunizations.</li></ul></li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>V.

PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>DCFS Staff, POS Staff and Mandated Reporters</p><p><strong>III. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</strong></p><p><strong>Public Act 101-0564</strong> redefines who is statutorily recognized as Mandated Reporters in the State of Illinois, and what is to be considered “a child known to them in their professional or official capacities”. It prescribes reporting requirements when there are two or more persons working together who share concerns about whether a child is abused or neglected and who else can make a report with reasonable cause. It also adds mandated reporter training frequency and requirements, including sources of training for mandated reporters and licensed practitioners and reporting of completed training.</p><p><strong>Public Act 101-0237</strong> establishes that when a Mandated Reporter makes a report to the State Central Register and there is a prior indicated report of abuse or neglect or there is a prior open service case involving any member of the household that the Department must minimally accept a report as a child welfare services referral. If the family refuses to cooperate or refuses access to the home or children, then a child protection service investigation shall be initiated if the facts meet the criteria to accept a report.</p><p><strong>IV.

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>This Policy Guide replaces Policy Guide 2008.02, Mexican Consulate Notification of Mexican or Mexican American minors in the Custody of the Department. The Memorandum of Understanding between the State of Illinois, Department of Children and Family Services and the Consulate General of Mexico in Chicago, provides for early identification of Mexican or Mexican American minors taken into protective custody by the Department. The child welfare practice issues inherent in the Memorandum of Understanding are directed toward ensuring that the needs of Mexican or Mexican American minors are met when their families are temporarily or permanently unavailable. This revised policy addresses procedures that will facilitate the early coordination of legal and social services to children and their relatives that may be necessary to achieve permanency for the child, including providing the least restrictive placement and supportive services to maintain family ties, ensure appropriate visitation and maintain the child’s ethnic, religious and cultural identity.</p><p>The Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Children and Family Services and the Consulate General of Mexico requires DCFS to notify the Mexican Consulate when a child is determined to be of Mexican ancestry. In order to comply with this requirement DCFS child protection and child welfare and POS workers are to notify the Office of Latino Services which is responsible for notification to the Mexican Consulate.</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>DCFS Child Protection Staff and Supervisors and all DCFS and POS Intact Family Services Workers, their Supervisors, Managers and Administrators.</p><p><strong>III. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</strong></p><p>The Consular Convention between the United States of America and the United Mexican States (Bilateral Convention) and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention) provide for consular notification and access in cases where foreign nationals are involved in legal proceedings. These treaties establish the right of representatives or agents of any embassy or consulate of a foreign government to freely communicate with, and have access to, its nationals without interference from the host state.</p><p>The Department recognizes the importance of early identification of Mexican or Mexican American minors taken into protective custody in order to protect the fundamental rights of Mexican Nationals and, to the extent possible, provide all of the protections afforded to them by the Vienna Convention, the Bilateral Convention and all other applicable treaties and laws.</p><p><strong>IV. DEFINITIONS</strong></p><p>“Mexican” means any person who is a national of Mexico, regardless of immigration status in the United States. For consular notification purposes, a minor reported as born in Mexico will be assumed to be a Mexican national.</p><p>“Mexican minor” means any unmarried person who is under the age of eighteen and was born in Mexico.</p><p>“Mexican American minor” means any unmarried person who is under the age of eighteen, was born in the United States, and who is eligible for Mexican nationality as the biological child of at least one Mexican national.</p><p>“Mexican custodian” means the non-parental caretaker of a Mexican minor, who has been entrusted by a parent(s) with the day-to-day care of the minor for any period of time.</p><p>“DIF” means the Agency for Integral Family Development. This is the agency in Mexico charged with ensuring the welfare of minors.</p><p><strong>V. DETERMINATION OF MEXICAN LINEAGE</strong></p><p>Child protection workers are required to establish ancestry of every child taken into protective custody. At the beginning of an investigation, <strong>child protection workers will distribute the pamphlet CFS 1050-26, Guide for Parents who are Mexican Nationals,</strong> to all Hispanic subjects of reports. In addition, the Memorandum of Understanding between the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services and the Consulate General of Mexico requires the Department to notify the Mexican Consulate in writing within ten working days of the decision to take protective custody of a Mexican or Mexican American minor or at any time one of the following occurs:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>A child for whom the Department is legally responsible (including protective custody) is identified as having Mexican ancestry.</li><li>A parent or custodian of a Mexican or Mexican American minor requests that the consulate be notified.</li><li>The Department learns that a non-custodial parent resides in Mexico.</li></ul><p><strong>VI. RIGHTS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OF MEXICAN ANCESTRY</strong></p><p>The DCFS Office of Latino Services is notified of every case that has been opened for a Hispanic child. Children who are determined to be of Mexican ancestry and who are age appropriate, and their parents or custodians shall be advised that:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>They have the right to freely communicate with consular officers of their country.</li><li>The Mexican Consular Representatives may interview Mexican or Mexican American minors in the custody of the Department.</li><li>The Mexican Consulate can receive specific information, otherwise confidential regarding the reason protective custody of the Mexican minor was taken.</li><li>The Mexican Consulate can assist the Mexican child, parents or custodians in legal proceedings.</li></ul><p><strong>VII. INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE MEXICAN CONSULATE</strong></p><p>The DCFS Office of Latino Services is responsible for the notification to the Mexican Consulate and to the Guardianship Administrator that a Mexican or Mexican American minor is in the custody/guardianship of the Department. The initial notification provided to the Mexican Consulate by the Office of Latino Services shall include the name of the minor; the minor’s date of birth, if known; the names, emails, address and telephone number of the parents or custodians, if known; the consent of the parents or custodian to the disclosure; and the name, email and telephone number of the assigned Department caseworker and the caseworker’s supervisor. Workers are to complete the <strong>CFS 1000-6, Notification to Mexican Consulate</strong> (attached) and submit it to the Office of Latino Services as indicated in section XI of this Policy Guide.</p><p><strong>VIII. CONSULATE ACCESS TO MEXICAN OR MEXICAN AMERICAN MINORS IN THE CUSTODY OF THE DEPARTMENT</strong></p><p>Although Consular Representatives have the right to interview Mexican minors in the custody of the Department, they must first obtain the approval of the Office of the Guardianship Administrator to interview Department children in care who are of Mexican American ancestry. All interview requests must be submitted to the Guardianship Administrator or designee.</p><p><strong>IX. SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS FOR MEXICAN MINORS</strong></p><p>The Mexican Consulate will assist the Department in obtaining the necessary documentation from Mexico for Mexican minors in the Department’s custody who are eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile status.</p><p><strong>X. ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY MEXICAN CONSULATE REGARDING DIF</strong></p><p>The Mexican Consulate can assist DCFS and POS caseworkers in obtaining appropriate home studies of families in Mexico who may be resources for these Mexican minors by contacting the DIF. The Mexican Consulate will also ensure that the DIF provides appropriate and necessary services to Mexican minors for whom the Department is legally responsible when they are placed in Mexico, including having monitoring reports forwarded to DCFS and POS caseworkers.</p><p><strong>XI.

Almost one-fourth of all children and youth in the United States are either immigrants or children of immigrants. As the immigrant population is growing, the numbers in child welfare have also increased slightly. In serving these families, DCFS and POS caseworkers may encounter another dynamic regarding the legal status of immigrant adult caregivers in living in the United States.</p><p><strong>PURPOSE</strong></p><p>This Section of Appendix F provides guidance for DCFS and POS workers and supervisors working with families who may have the potential to becoming involved in deportation proceedings. It is not the intent of the Department to provide legal advice for these families but rather to provide guidance to assist families (traditional foster care, Home of Relative and biological) in making a care plan for the children in their homes in the event that the caretaker is detained due to his or her undocumented legal status in the United States. Additionally, a list of resources is included at the end of this attachment, which may be given to families when they are developing their care plans.</p><p><strong>DEVELOPING A PLAN OF ACTION IF AN EMERGENCY PLACEMENT BECOMES NECESSARY</strong></p><p>When assisting families in developing their care plan, caseworkers should review existing policy, which provides the guidelines for developing a plan of action if an emergency placement becomes necessary. DCFS and POS workers with intact or placement cases will ensure families have appropriate child care plans in case of an emergency.</p><p><strong>WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY?</strong></p><p>For the purpose of this transmittal, an emergency is defined as the death or absence of a parent or foster parent (i.e. car or medical accident, parent detained by law enforcement, victim of a serious crime, etc.). See Procedures 302.387 (b) for additional information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES</strong><br><strong>October 2, 2020 – Attached to PG 2020.13</strong></p><p><strong>CASEWORKER RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p><p>Caseworkers must:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Have parents or foster parents identify a family member or friend to care for their children in advance in case of an emergency;</li><li>Tell the parents or foster parents to have the telephone numbers of these identified persons with them at all times and make sure you document this information in the case file;</li><li>Contact the identified persons to ensure they are in agreement with providing alternative care for the children should an emergency arise; and</li><li>Identify and utilize appropriate resource services to assist in such situations (staff will provide relevant information from the attached resources list to parents and foster parents as related to their specific needs and situation).</li></ol><p>Caseworkers or supervisors who have questions about developing an emergency plan of care may contact the Immigration Services Unit at 312-814-8600 or by e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:DCFS.IMMIGRATIONUNIT@illinois.gov\">DCFS.IMMIGRATIONUNIT@illinois.gov</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>GUARDIANSHIP SERVICES</strong><br><strong>October 2, 2020 – Attached to PG 2020.13</strong><br><br><strong>List of Resources for Services to the Immigrant Community</strong></p><p><strong>Arab</strong><br>Arab American Family Services<br>7000 W. 111th Street Worth, IL 60482 Phone: 708-599-2237 Fax: 708-229-2601</p><p><strong>Asian</strong><br>Apua Ghar, Inc.<br>4350 N.

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to incorporate how maximum capacity within a foster family home is determined, and provide procedures regarding the process for requesting and granting expanded capacity waivers in licensed foster homes, unlicensed relative homes, and fictive kin homes pursuant to changes in State law.</p><p>The Department is working on proposed amendments necessary to ensure affected rules and procedures align with this Policy Guide and will follow the established rule-making process.</p><p>This Policy Guide is effective immediately and replaces Policy Guide 2018.10.</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>The primary users of this Policy Guide are Department and Private Agency foster care licensing and child welfare staff, child protection staff, and Placement Clearance Desk staff.</p><p><strong>III. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</strong></p><p>The Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA) was signed into federal law on February 9, 2018, and included requirements for the Children’s Bureau to develop and adopt National Model Foster Family Home Licensing Standards. National Model Foster Family Home Licensing Standards were adopted and issued by the Children’s Bureau on February 4, 2019.</p><p>In response to the National Model Foster Family Home Licensing Standards, the Child Care Act of 1969, Section 2.17 was amended on July 12, 2019 to include additional provisions for expanded license capacities in foster family homes.</p><p>This Policy Guide contains the July 12, 2019 revisions to the Child Care Act, and an updated process for requesting and granting expanded capacity waivers related to placement restrictions in licensed foster homes, unlicensed relative homes, or fictive kin homes.</p><p><strong>IV. SUMMARY OF REVISIONS TO THE CHILD CARE ACT OF 1969</strong></p><p><em>Sec. 2.17. \"Foster family home\" means a facility for child care in residences of families who receive no more than 6 children unrelated to them, unless all the children are of common parentage, or residences of relatives who receive no more than 6 related children placed by the Department, unless the children are of common parentage, for the purpose of providing family care and training for the children on a full-time basis, except the Director of Children and Family Services, pursuant to Department regulations, may waive the numerical limitation of foster children who may be cared for in a foster family home for any of the following reasons to allow: (1) a parenting youth in foster care to remain with the child of the parenting youth; (2) siblings to remain together; (3) a child with an established meaningful relationship with the family to remain with the family; or (4) a family with special training or skills to provide care to a child who has a severe disability.</em><br>(Source: P.A. 101-63, eff. 7-12-19)</p><p>The number of children allowed to reside in a foster family home is 6 children. An expanded capacity request is required to allow for more than 6 children under 18 years of age to reside in a foster family home. <strong>The Child Care Act no longer sets a maximum number of children permitted to reside in a foster family home with an expanded capacity license.</strong></p><p><strong>V.

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to inform Department and Purchase of Services (POS) licensing staff of new requirements, which are consistent with the Consumer Product Safety Commission safety guidelines, regarding swimming pools and other bodies of water located on the licensed premises of a foster home.</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>The primary users of this policy guide are Department and POS foster home licensing staff.</p><p><strong>III. BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>This Policy Guide summarizes the Department’s new water safety standards for foster homes. Licensing staff shall immediately ensure licensed foster homes receive the new standards and work with foster homes to come into compliance with them. These new safety policies for Foster Family Homes are being added to Rules and Procedures 402, which are currently under revision and will be available to staff in the near future.</p><p><strong>IV. SUMMARY OF NEW POOL AND WATER SAFETY REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p><strong>In-ground Pools</strong></p><p>All in-ground pools located on the foster home’s premises shall be fenced, or have a power safety cover that meets standards in the American Society for Testing &amp; Materials that the Consumer Product Safety Commission has adopted.</p><p><strong>Above-ground Pools</strong></p><p>All above-ground pools shall have non-climbable side walls that are at least 4 feet high or shall be enclosed with fence that is at least 36 inches away from the pool’s side wall. This requirement pertains to the entire circumference or perimeter of the pool. When the pool is not in use, steps used to access the pool shall be removed or shall be enclosed by a fence.</p><p><strong>Hot Tubs</strong></p><p>All hot tubs shall be fenced, or have a securely fitted and locked cover.</p><p><strong>Portable Pools</strong></p><p>All portable pools shall be fenced, or be emptied and sanitized daily.</p><p><strong>Fences and Barriers to Entry</strong></p><p>All fences enclosing pools shall have gates that open out and away from the pool, have a locking device and are designed to be self-closing and self-latching. Gates with a release mechanism located less than 54 inches from the bottom of the gate shall be located at least 3 inches below the top of the gate on the side facing the pool. A gate shall not have an opening greater than ½ inch within 18 inches of the latch release mechanism.</p><p>All fences shall be at least 5 feet in height, measured from the side of the barrier which faces away from the swimming pool. Vertical barriers for the fence shall be no more than 4 inches wide. Horizontal barriers shall be placed on the swimming pool side of the fence and be no more than 4 inches apart. A fence shall not have any decorative cut-outs, indentations or protrusions that are more than 1 ¾ inches and could be used as holds to climb the fence. The fence shall not have more than 4 inches between the ground and the bottom of the barrier.</p><p>When a house wall serves as part of a pool barrier, any door or window that provides access to a swimming pool shall be equipped with an alarm that sounds for 30 seconds or more within 7 seconds after the door is opened. The alarm shall be distinct from other sounds in the house and able to be heard by all household members, regardless of their location on the licensed premises of the foster home. The alarm shall have a de-activate feature that is at least 54 inches above the threshold of the door covered by the alarm. The alarm shall have an automatic reset feature. All alarms must meet the requirements of UL2017 – General Purpose Signaling Devices and Systems.</p><p>Note: Foster homes that have a license or a permit on January 1, 2009 and have had a fence with a minimum height of 3 ½ foot shall be considered in compliance.</p><p><strong>Foster Parent Safety Training, Supervision of Children and Documentation</strong></p><p>Licensees in foster family homes with pools, hot tubs, ponds, outdoor fountains, decorative water ponds, fishponds or other pools of water must have current CPR/First Aid certification.</p><p>A foster child of any age shall not use a swimming pool, portable pool, spa, hot tub or other pools of water located on the premises of the foster home without line of sight supervision by a foster parent or other adult authorized by the foster parent.</p><p>Licensees shall be responsible to keep toxic chemicals related to pool maintenance locked up and inaccessible to foster children.</p><p>When a swimming pool is in use, a licensee shall keep a weekly log to record water quality test results and otherwise maintain the pool in a safe and sanitary condition.</p><p><strong>V.

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to inform investigation and casework staff of revised requirements in recording Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) required tracking information, including but not limited to, client gender, race, and ethnicity, on the <strong>CFS 1410, CFS 718 A and CFS 718 B,</strong> and subsequently on the <strong>CFS 484</strong> when the permanency goal changes to <strong>Adoption (25)</strong> or <strong>Subsidized Guardianship (26)</strong> in Department data systems such as SACWIS and CYCIS. New CYCIS and SACWIS codes are being added to more accurately reflect personal data gathered by staff and to correctly code when staff is unable to gather specific gender, race and ethnicity information. These new codes are to be used in CYCIS and SACWIS, including but not limited to, when entering and correcting individual information from the <strong>CFS 1410, CFS 718 A and CFS 718 B,</strong> and the <strong>CFS 484</strong> form. These forms have been updated to reflect these changes.</p><p>Accurate data collection and recording is critical to child welfare planning, service delivery, internal and external reporting, and funding. Data must be reviewed, verified, collected and, if needed, corrected as early as possible from case opening and throughout the life of the case.</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>Primary users are DCFS and POS Child Protection Specialists, Child Welfare Staff, their Supervisors and Managers, CAPU Staff and Supervisors, Regional Clerical, Regional Adoption Coordinators and their Staff, Licensing Staff and Supervisors, and Licensing Application Clerical Staff and Supervisors.</p><p><strong>III. BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>It is widely recognized that data is utilized in child welfare organizations to make decisions, plan for programs and initiatives, measure outcomes and ultimately improve service delivery to children and families. In addition to data used to determine state level planning and service delivery for programs such as State funded adoptions and guardianship services, states are required to periodically provide data to the Administration of Children and Families (ACF) on state programs. Data reported to ACF is used to determine state level compliance with federal measures and to establish program improvement guidelines when improvements are necessary.</p><p>AFCARS collects case-level information from state and tribal Title IV-E agencies on all children in foster care and those who have been adopted with Title IV-E agency involvement. Examples of data reported in AFCARS include demographic information on the foster child as well as the foster and adoptive parents, the number of removal episodes a child has experienced, the number of placements in the current removal episode, and the current placement setting. Title IV-E agencies are required to submit the AFCARS data twice a year based on two 6-month reporting periods.&nbsp;</p><p>It is the expectation of the Department that critical data collected on children and families served by the Department is accurate and recorded in a timely manner. These instructions are intended to ensure that staff responsible for recording case level data is informed of the requirements for data entry.</p><p><strong>IV. CFS 1410, CASE OPENING/REGISTRATION FORM INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p><p>Before creating the <strong>CFS 1410</strong>, the following should be completed for each case member on their individual person management screens in <strong>SACWIS</strong> (items listed with * indicate required). Staff shall pay special attention and are responsible for the accurate and full completion of all required data. Please follow the instructions below in order to properly complete the “Gender,” “Primary Race”, and “Ethnicity” fields which have been defined by the Federal government.</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li><strong>Basic information Tab*</strong> Correct spelling of last and first name, middle name if available<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><p><strong>* Gender</strong></p><p>Enter the appropriate code for each client listed.

CFS 718, Authorization for Background Check Forms</strong></p><p>The <strong>CFS 718 A, Authorization for Background Check - Foster Care and Adoption</strong> and <strong>CFS 718 B, Authorization for Background Check - Child Care</strong> have been revised to accommodate accurate identification and documentation of race and ethnicity. Prior to submitting the Authorization for Background Check form to the licensing worker or the Central Office of Licensing, as indicated in the instructions, for completion and entry into the BC-03 screen, the licensing or placement/adoption worker must check the form for completeness and accuracy, making sure that the race and ethnicity codes outlined on the form and under Section IV of this Policy Guide have been used correctly.</p><p><strong>VI. CFS 484, Adoption/Guardianship Tracking form</strong></p><p>When the permanency goal changes to either <strong>Adoption (25)</strong> or <strong>Subsidized Guardianship (26)</strong>, the <strong>CFS 484</strong> must be completed to document various AFCARS requirements established by ACF. The worker having responsibility for developing the adoption or guardianship packet is also responsible for thoroughly completing the <strong>CFS 484</strong>. The responsible worker is to use the gender, race, and ethnicity codes outlined under Section IV of this Policy Guide to capture the accurate data.</p><p>The completed <strong>CFS 484</strong> will be submitted to the designated DCFS adoption unit at the point of submitting the adoption or guardianship packet for Department approval.</p><p>During the review of the adoption or guardianship packet, the DCFS adoption supervisor will ensure the <strong>CFS 484</strong> is accurately and fully completed.</p><p>Following the DCFS adoption supervisor’s approval of the adoption or guardianship packet, a copy of the <strong>CFS 484</strong> will be forwarded to the designated adoption clerical for data entry.</p><p><strong>VII.

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to define a process and timelines for information sharing and collaboration between the Department and a school system to facilitate the educational transition of children and youth stepping down from residential placement to attendance at local schools. <strong>The Department is committed to providing all school districts a 30 day notice and a child’s educational information when a child or youth will be stepping down from residential care into the local school system.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>Primary users of this Policy Guide are child welfare staff and child welfare supervisors in the Department and purchase of service agencies who are responsible for children being transitioned from residential care to community placements.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III. KEY WORDS</strong></p><p>Education, step-down, residential placement, local school systems, Chicago Board of Education.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IV. BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>The Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) and the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) have developed a protocol to provide educational information to schools &nbsp;- generally 30 days prior to the child’s or youth’s local placement. &nbsp;The protocol was developed to support the Department’s and the schools’ mutual goals to ensure that appropriate educational services are provided to those children and youth for whom the Department is legally responsible and who are transitioning from residential facilities and group homes located within and outside the State of Illinois to other living arrangements where they will be attending school in their local community. &nbsp;For purposes of this protocol, this transition process will be referred to as “step-down”.&nbsp;</p><p>Details of the protocol with the Chicago Public Schools follow.</p><p><strong>V. PROTOCOL</strong></p><p>The protocol for children and youth engaged in the step-down process is intended to ensure adequate and timely planning for their receipt of appropriate educational services. &nbsp;Essential elements of the protocol are timely communication between DCFS and the local education agency (LEA) regarding the educational needs of identified children and youth and the identification and location of educational services. &nbsp;It is anticipated that children and youth involved in the step-down process will have a variety of unique and complex educational considerations. &nbsp;As such, the protocol provides the maximum amount of planning time as practical for DCFS and the LEA to exchange information and engage in a collaborative process to consider and meet the individual educational needs of each child or youth.&nbsp;</p><p>The following protocol has been implemented by DCFS and the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and will be revised as needed.&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li>DCFS shall take all necessary and reasonable steps to ensure that CPS receives adequate notice that a child or youth for whom the Department is legally responsible needs to be enrolled in an appropriate publicly-funded educational setting.&nbsp;<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>To the extent possible, <strong>DCFS will give the CPS 30 days written notice</strong> of an intended step-down of a child or youth for whom the Department is legally responsible who will be moving into or within the CPS system in order that CPS may facilitate and coordinate the provision of educational services. &nbsp;DCFS and CPS recognize that there will be exceptions to the 30-day notice provision since DCFS’ placement decisions may be affected by factors external to DCFS and not subject to its control (such as psychiatric hospital placements where the average stay is 21 days, court orders, out-of-state placement disruptions, or the closing of a residential facility which necessitates new placements in less than thirty days.)&nbsp;</li><li>Once DCFS identifies that a child or youth who is a ward will be stepped-down, DCFS will forward his/her educational records to the designated person at CPS Central Office.</li><li>As soon as DCFS has notice that a child or youth who is a ward will be stepped-down and the location or approximate location (i.e., Zip Code, geographic area) where he/she will reside has been determined, DCFS will provide this information to the designated person at CPS Central Office.&nbsp;</li><li>DCFS will share pertinent data about a child or youth who is a ward with the LEA. &nbsp;Examples of data which may be shared include: the child’s or youth’s name, age, gender, primary language, projected placement address, DCFS identification number, name and telephone number of the DCFS or POS caseworker and the caseworker’s supervisor’s name and telephone number. &nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>After DCFS determines the location of a child’s or youth’s placement, DCFS and CPS will promptly discuss individual student assessment and planning.&nbsp;<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Once DCFS knows the child’s or youth’s &nbsp;new address, the agency will provide the CPS Central Office with the following information: &nbsp;completed questionnaire specifically designed for the step-down process; the child’s or youth’s new address; immunization information; a release of information form; and if the child or youth who is a ward is currently participating in special education, a copy of his/her most recent Individualized Education Program (“IEP”).&nbsp;</li><li>Upon receipt of this information from DCFS, the CPS Central Office designee will promptly call the child’s or youth’s &nbsp;DCFS or POS (private agency) child welfare worker to discuss the questionnaire and to determine appropriate school placement.</li><li>If the CPS Central Office designee and the DCFS or POS child welfare worker determine that a child or youth is eligible or potentially eligible for special education services, CPS will immediately request the appointment of a surrogate parent by the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE).</li><li>If the CPS Central Office designee determines that a child or youth is in need of a specialized school placement, the case will be forwarded to the appropriate CPS personnel.</li><li>If the child or youth is in need of a general school placement, the CPS Central Office designee will notify the appropriate local school to prepare for his/her enrollment.&nbsp;</li><li>Once CPS has identified the appropriate school placement, the CPS Central Office designee will arrange a meeting with the DCFS or POS caseworker, foster parent, the child or youth who is a ward (when chronologically age-appropriate), local school personnel and surrogate parent (as appropriate) to develop a plan at the school identifying and effectuating the appropriate supports if necessary for the child or youth to be enrolled and educationally successful.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>The CPS shall take all reasonable and necessary steps to ensure that a child or youth who is a ward is enrolled in an appropriate publicly funded educational setting within two school-days of his/her stepping-down into or within the CPS. &nbsp;Exceptions to the two school-day general policy related to unique circumstances are subject to agreement by CPS Chief Specialized Services Officer and the DCFS Guardian that additional planning and implementation time is necessary to meet the individual educational needs of the child or youth. &nbsp;</li><li>DCFS and CPS recognize and agree that a substantial amount of information about the child or youth identified in Section A(4) and B(1) above is considered privileged and confidential and as part of his/her mental health record, will be released only to CPS’ Central Office designee, with DCFS’ Guardian’s consent. &nbsp;Additionally, this information may be shared with local school staff only with the consent of the DCFS Guardian.&nbsp;<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>CPS agrees to obtain and retain locked file cabinets to be physically located at the school district administrative offices for the purpose of storing this information.</li><li>CPS agrees to develop strict procedures to ensure that only those designated individuals who have been authorized to retrieve and/or review this information are permitted access to the locked file cabinets.&nbsp;</li><li>CPS agrees to maintain a record of access or disclosure of the child’s or youth’s educational records and to report to DCFS any access to this information by unauthorized individuals and any unauthorized public dissemination of this information.&nbsp;</li><li>DCFS and CPS agree that only information jointly determined to be necessary to provide supports for the child’s or youths educational success will be provided to the local school.&nbsp;</li><li>The information shall not be considered to be part of the child’s or youth’s temporary record while he or she attends school in the CPS district.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>DCFS will promptly notify the CPS Central Office designee who has a child’s or youth’s information (as identified in Sections A[4] and B[1]) in his or her possession, in writing, &nbsp;if the child or youth will not be attending school in the CPS.&nbsp;<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Upon receiving this notification by DCFS, the CPS Central Office designee will destroy the information, preferably by shredding.&nbsp;</li><li>Once CPS has destroyed the information, CPS shall notify DCFS of its action in writing.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>VI. CHILD WELFARE WORKER RESPONSIBILITY</strong></p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Consistent with the above-described Protocol, once DCFS determines that a child or youth for whom it is legally responsible will be stepped-down, the assigned child welfare worker will request the child or youth’s educational records from the residential facility. &nbsp;<strong>Form CFS 582, Educational Information for Step-down Transition from Residential Placements,</strong> shall be used for that purpose. (Copy attached.)&nbsp;</li><li>In the event that the residential facility does not or cannot return the completed CFS 582 within thirty days, the assigned child welfare worker shall complete the CFS 582 using data from the child’s or youth’s case record.</li><li>When the child’s or youth’s educational records are received from the residential facility or assembled from records previously obtained, the child welfare worker &nbsp;will forward the CFS 582, any IEPs and related documents &nbsp;to the designated person at local education agency.&nbsp;</li><li>At the request of school personnel, the assigned caseworker is expected to participate in meetings with school personnel, foster parent, surrogate parent (as appropriate) and the child or youth (as appropriate) to develop and implement plans for the child or youth educational transition.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>VII. APPLICABILITY</strong></p><p>The above-described Protocol was developed in conjunction with the Chicago Public Schools as the local education agency for that community. &nbsp;DCFS and POS child welfare staff enrolling children and youth in the Chicago Public Schools are expected to follow its procedures and timelines. &nbsp;</p><p>Outside the area served by the &nbsp;Chicago Public Schools system, the Protocol shall be used as a model by Regional Administrators and their staff to develop agreements with local education agencies or individual schools throughout the state where structured planning is needed to facilitate the educational transition. Local or regional conditions may require modification of some aspects of the protocol. &nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of whether or not an agreement with a local education agency is in place, <strong>DCFS and POS child welfare staff must always</strong>:&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td>X</td><td>work proactively and collaboratively with local education agencies to meet the developmental and educational needs of children and youth for whom the Department is legally responsible;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>actively participate with local education agencies and schools in the development of plans to meet the developmental and educational needs of children and &nbsp;youth for whom the Department is legally responsible</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td><strong>provide local education agencies 30 days written notice</strong> when a child or youth will be “stepping down” from residential care into the local school system; and&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>share information with the local education agency which will aid the development of education plans appropriate to the needs of children and youth for whom the Department is legally responsible consistent with Part 431, Confidentiality of Personal Information of Persons Served by the Department of Children and Family Services.&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>VIII.

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p><strong>I. PURPOSE</strong></p><p>This Policy Guide addresses how sibling cases in Cook County are assigned to purchase of service agencies and the requirements of agencies to place siblings together from the point of assignment. The protocol was developed in partnership with Cook County Purchase of Service staff to assist agency compliance with the Aristotle P. Consent Decree. These instructions will be included in the forthcoming Cook County Case Assignment Protocol. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>The primary users of these procedures are placement staff of the Department and Purchase of Service agencies.</p><p><strong>III. KEY WORDS</strong></p><p>Case Assignment Placement Unit (CAPU), sibling placements, Secondary Match System.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IV. BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>In compliance with the Aristotle P. Consent Decree, the Department and case management agencies must make all reasonable efforts to place siblings together. &nbsp;Additional information on Sibling Placements may be found in DCFS Rule and Procedure 301.70.</p><p><strong>V. REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p>Purchase of Service Agencies are expected to provide immediate placement for traditional cases at the time of assignment, which may require the agency to recruit and develop emergency and traditional foster homes with the capacity for sibling groups. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li><p><strong>Sibling Groups of Three or Fewer</strong></p><p>For new cases of three or fewer siblings, assignments will be based on the geographic process described in the Cook County Case Assignment Protocol. The assigned agency will be expected to identify one placement to accommodate all siblings. The assignment process will follow this order:&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>&nbsp;The assigned agency must be able to verify the ability to place the sibling group together within one hour of notification by the Case Assignment Placement Unit (CAPU).&nbsp;</li><li>If the agency is unable to place the sibling group together, the case will be re-rotated to another agency. &nbsp;The case will be rotated to a maximum of three agencies.</li><li>If the third agency is unable to place the sibling group together, the Case Assignment Placement Unit (CAPU) will refer the case to a Department contracted sibling program.</li><li>If the contracted sibling program is unable to accept the case, the assignment will remain with the initial agency.&nbsp;</li><li><p>If the assigned agency is unable to provide a placement for all siblings together, the case must be posted on the Secondary Match System within <strong>five</strong> days of assignment. &nbsp;It is the responsibility of the assigned agency to conduct a diligent search for a foster home for all siblings within 30 days of assignment, in compliance with DCFS Rule 301.70, and provide sibling contact and visitation in compliance with DCFS Rules 301.220 and 301.230. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When a placement is identified with another agency, case management responsibility will be transferred to the licensing agency unless the transfer is clinically contraindicated as determined by the Office of the Executive Deputy Director. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>If the assigned agency is unable to locate a placement for all siblings within <strong>30</strong> days, documentation of the diligent search and/or documentation of clinical reasons that prevent placement together must be submitted to the DCFS-Division of POS Monitoring. Sufficient documentation may include one or more of the following:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li>Print-out of the child profile screen and broadcast results from the Secondary Match System;</li><li>Copies of Payment-Placement Authorization form (CFS 906);&nbsp;</li><li>Copies of approved and/or submitted Level of Care;&nbsp;</li><li>Copies of approved and/or submitted PRT;</li><li>Psychological evaluation</li><li>SACY safety plans;&nbsp;</li><li>Clinical staffing notes signed by a supervisor; and/or</li><li>Completed 30-day comprehensive assessment.</li></ol><p>If the assigned agency is unable to provide sufficient documentation or demonstrate reasonable efforts within 30 days or assignment, the agency will maintain case management but will receive a contract deduction for inability to place. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ol></li><li><strong>Sibling Groups of Four or More</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><p><strong>Referrals to Department Contracted Sibling Programs</strong></p><p>New cases of four or more siblings should be considered for identified Department contracted sibling programs. &nbsp;CAPU will determine if the case meets the program eligibility requirements, and will contact the designated intake liaison. &nbsp;If the agency accepts the case, the case will be assigned to the appropriate contract and worker. &nbsp;If the agency is unable to accept the case or if the case does not fit within the program requirements, the case will be rotated per the rules of the Cook County Case Assignment Protocol.</p></li><li><strong>Rotated Assignments&nbsp;</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li><p><strong>Protective Custody- Immediate Placement</strong></p><p>New cases of four or more siblings that are not appropriate for a Department contracted sibling program will be rotated per the rules of the Cook County Case Assignment Protocol. The assigned agency will be notified of assignment by CAPU staff, and will be expected to immediately identify placement for the siblings. Agencies will then take the following steps to place the children:&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman;\" type=\"i\"><li>Agencies must make efforts to identify a single placement for the entire sibling group, both within their own agency and other public and private Cook County providers. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><p>If the agency is unable to immediately identify a single placement within their own system or through another provider, the agency must place the children in an appropriate emergency placement, and post the case on the Secondary Match System within <strong>five</strong> days of assignment. &nbsp;</p><p>It is the responsibility of the assigned agency to conduct a diligent search for a foster home for all siblings within 30 days of assignment, in compliance with DCFS Rule 301.70, and provide sibling contact and visitation in compliance with DCFS Rules 301.220 and 301.230</p></li><li>When a placement is identified with another agency, case management responsibility will be transferred to the licensing agency unless the transfer is clinically contraindicated as determined by the Office of the Executive Deputy Director. &nbsp;</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to locate a placement for all siblings within 30 days, documentation of the diligent search and/or documentation of clinical reasons that prevent placement together must be submitted to the DCFS-Division of POS Monitoring</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to provide sufficient documentation or demonstrate reasonable efforts within 30 days or assignment, the agency will maintain case management but will receive a contract deduction for inability to place.</li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Non-PC Cases- Disrupted Intact Cases</strong></p><p>The assignment of new child cases that were formally served as an intact family will follow the rules of the Cook County Case Assignment Protocol. &nbsp;</p><p>For cases in which protective custody has not been taken, and a court date is set for Temporary Custody (TC), the screening worker must submit all case opening information to CAPU prior to the TC hearing. &nbsp;The expectations of the assigned placement agency are as follows:&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>The assigned placement agency is expected to identify an appropriate placement prior to TC and to attend the TC hearing, but becomes responsible at the point TC is granted.&nbsp;</li><li>Because the child(ren) do not require immediate placement, the assigned placement agency will be given twenty-four (24) hours to identify a single placement for the entire sibling group. &nbsp;</li><li>If the assigned agency cannot identify a single placement, within their own or another agency’s system, CAPU will reassign the case and the first agency will receive a contract deduction for inability to place. &nbsp;</li><li>When a placement is identified at another agency, case management responsibility will be transferred to the licensing agency, unless the transfer is clinically contraindicated as determined by the Office of the Executive Deputy Director. &nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>Add-on Sibling Assignment&nbsp;</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><p><strong>Case Consolidation with a Single Agency&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When a new sibling case is opened, the case will be assigned per the rules of the Cook County Case Assignment Protocol. &nbsp;</p><ol><li>If only one agency is responsible for all sibling cases, the new child case will be assigned to the same agency. &nbsp;The agency must make all reasonable efforts to place the new child with a/all siblings. &nbsp;</li><li>If the sibling is placed apart, the assigned agency will provide for contact and visitation between the siblings in accordance with DCFS Rules 301.220 and 301.230.&nbsp;</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to place the new child with a/all siblings within 30 days, documentation of the diligent search and/or documentation of clinical reasons that prevent placement together must be submitted to the DCFS-Division of POS Monitoring. &nbsp;</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to provide sufficient documentation or demonstrate reasonable efforts within 30 days or assignment to place the new child with a/all siblings, the agency will maintain case management but will receive a contract deduction for inability to place. &nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Case Consolidation with Multiple Agencies&nbsp;</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li><p>If multiple agency’s share case responsibility of open sibling cases, the new sibling case will be assigned per the rules of the Cook County Case Assignment Protocol.. &nbsp;</p><p>When the identified agency is contacted by CAPU with the new child case, the agency will be expected to pursue placement of the new child with at least one sibling.</p></li><li><p>The initial agency must determine if they can place the new child with all/a sibling within one hour of assignment by CAPU. &nbsp;If a placement with a sibling is not possible, CAPU will contact the other agency(s) involved with the family in the following order: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman;\" type=\"i\"><li>most siblings in any placement type&nbsp;</li><li>most siblings in traditional (non-specialized) foster or &nbsp;home of relative.&nbsp;</li><li>any sibling in traditional (non-specialized) foster or &nbsp;home of relative</li><li>sibling in any foster care placement type.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Children in non-foster care living arrangements, as verified by a current CFS 906 and in CYCIS, will not be considered when evaluating sibling placement together (i.e. Runaway, Detention, Department of Corrections, Institution, Group Home, Independent Living, Health Care Facility, Hospital, College, Armed Services Duty, or Emergency Shelters)&nbsp;</p></li><li>Each agency will be given one hour to respond to CAPU prior to CAPU contacting the next agency. &nbsp;If no involved agency is able to place the add-on child with a sibling, the assignment to the initial agency will stand.&nbsp;</li><li>The assigned agency must contact the sibling’s agencies(s) to plan a consolidated placement.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;If the sibling is placed apart, the assigned agency will provide for contact and visitation between the siblings in accordance with DCFS Rules 301.220 and 301.230. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to place the new child with a/all siblings within 30 days, documentation of the diligent search and/or documentation of clinical reasons that prevent placement together must be submitted to the DCFS-Division of POS Monitoring.&nbsp;</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to provide sufficient documentation or demonstrate reasonable efforts within 30 days of assignment to place the new child with a/all siblings, the agency will maintain case management but will receive a contract deduction for inability to place. &nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>VI. COMPLIANCE</strong></p><p>The Department will closely monitor compliance with this and all other sibling protocols. &nbsp;Non-compliance with the Aristotle P . Consent Decree may result in Department imposed Corrective Action up to and including intake hold. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>VII.

The completed form must be submitted at the screenings.</li><li><p>Prior to the court Permanency Hearing at which a permanency goal of other than return home is first recommended by the Department. The CFS 1443 should not be completed while a parent is making substantial progress toward return home.</p><p>If at the Permanency Hearing, the Department recommends a “return home” goal, but the court sets a goal other than “return home”, the CFS 1443 shall be completed within two weeks of the court’s entry. A copy of the CFS 1443 shall be sent to the child’s Guardian ad litem and attorney.</p></li></ol><p><strong>IV. PROCEDURES FOR COMPLETING THE FORM</strong></p><p>To complete the CFS 1443 with foster parent/relative caregivers, the worker shall:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li>Convene a face-to-face family meeting with the caregiver(s).<strong> The meeting shall include the caregiver(s), caseworker and the adoption supervisor or specialist. The caregiver(s) should ask other family members or persons who serve as a support network for the family to attend.</strong></li><li>At the family meeting the Department representatives shall discuss and read through the contents of the permanency commitment form with the foster parent/relative caregiver(s). At a minimum, the following shall be included in the discussion:<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>An explanation of Department post adoption and guardianship services, including information regarding adoption or subsidized guardianship assistance. The booklet <strong>CFS 1050-45, Post Adoption and Guardianship Services 2000</strong>, should be reviewed with the caregivers and all questions they may have should be answered. A copy of the booklet shall be left with them.</li><li>If the caregivers are hesitant about committing to adoption, but show interest in guardianship, the booklet, <strong>CFS 1050-43, Making the Adoption/Guardianship Decision, </strong>should be reviewed with the family.</li><li>A clear understanding that adoption is final and legally no different than having a birth child.</li><li>Contingency plans should the caregiver(s) die or become incapacitated to the extent that they would be unable to care for the child(ren). It is in the discussion of such plans that it might be helpful to have other family members or friends present. Those present should be informed of the transferability of adoption or subsidized guardianship services in the event of the caregiver(s)’ death.</li><li>A recommendation that the caregivers attend the next permanency hearing.</li><li>Directions regarding who caregivers may call if they have further questions.</li></ol></li><li><p>Ask caregivers to complete and sign the form. Caregivers must complete and sign a separate form for each child, if there is more than one child. The caregivers’ signature must be witnessed by the caseworker. Caregivers who are married shall jointly sign the form.</p><p>Three original forms should be completed and signed for each child. One original remains with the caregiver, one original is for the agency files, and the final original will be presented in court at the next permanency hearing or at the Legal Screening/Pre-Screening, if termination of parental rights, subsidized guardianship, or expedited adoption (in Cook County) is being pursued.</p><p><strong>NOTE: Workers shall inform foster parent/relative caregiver’s that their agreement on the CFS 1443 to adopt or become the child’s guardian does not constitute a final decision and that the final placement selection cannot be made until after a thorough assessment of the child and family has been completed and the court, weighing many factors to determine what is in the best interest of the child, will make the final decision.</strong></p></li><li>If the caregiver is not interested in adopting the child or becoming the child’s guardian, ask the caregiver to initial the statements in Section 4 of the CFS 1443 and explain that another caregiver will be sought who is willing to adopt the child or become the child’s guardian. The current caregiver will then be asked to cooperate with the new caregiver in making a successful transition for the child. It must also be made clear to caregivers that if they change their mind, they will be considered on an equal footing with all other families being considered. If it is determined that a new family can better meet the needs of the child and it is in the best interests of the child, the child will be placed with the new family.</li><li>The process of working through the permanency commitment with caregivers may take several meetings and discussions with them. A time limit of one month should be given after the first meeting, in which time a decision must be made.</li></ol><p><strong>V. CASEWORKER’S USE OF THE FORM</strong></p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li><p><strong>Permanency Hearing</strong></p><p>The caseworker should be prepared to provide testimony at the permanency hearing regarding the family meeting and the caregiver’s decision as indicated on the permanency commitment form.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal Screening/ Pre-Screening </strong>(Legal screening refers to Downstate, pre-screening to Cook)</p><p><strong>Prior to legal screening/pre-screening:</strong></p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>If the permanency commitment form has already been completed, review the form with the caregiver/s to confirm that their position has not changed.</li><li>If the permanency commitment form has not been completed, do so now, following the steps described in Section IV above.</li><li>Include a copy of the commitment form with the legal screening packet.</li></ol><p><strong>At the legal screening/pre-screening:</strong></p><p>The caseworker should be prepared to provide details at the screening regarding the family meeting and the caregiver’s decision as indicated on the permanency commitment form.</p></li></ol><p><strong>VI.

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to issue instructions regarding the $3000.00 incentive payment the Department will pay to youth upon termination of an adoption assistance or guardianship subsidy as implemented by emergency rulemaking effective March 15, 2001.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>The primary users of this Policy Guide are all Department and private agency staff who negotiate adoption assistance and subsidized guardianship agreements with families.</p><p><strong>III. BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>Effective March 15, 2001, the Department adopted emergency amendments 89 Ill. Adm. Code 302, Services Delivered by the Department, which created a $3000.00 payment to Department wards, between the ages of 14 and 18 years, who are adopted or transferred to subsidized guardianship between March 15, 2001 and June 30, 2002. &nbsp;Youth meeting these criteria since the effective date of the amendment have been identified in the computer system and will receive the payment directly when their adoption or guardianship subsidy ends, as will youth who meet the criteria prior to June 30, 2002.&nbsp;</p><p>Staff have been reporting that judges and Guardians ad litem have been delaying adoption finalizations and guardianship orders due to the fact that the incentive payments are not included in the subsidy agreements. &nbsp;As an alternative to including the payment in the subsidy, the Department is adopting the following procedure:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:none;\" type=\"none\"><li>At the time prospective adoptive parents and subsidized guardians sign the subsidy agreements (CFS 470-C for adoption and CFS 482-A for subsidized guardianship), the worker shall give the parent/guardian the appropriate attached letter signed by the Department's Director along with a copy of Rule 302 which contains the incentive payment policy. Copies of Rule Sections 302.310 and 302.405 are attached for your convenience. The letter will serve as the Department's guarantee that the youth will receive the payment at the time the adoption or guardianship subsidy is terminated. &nbsp;The payment will be mailed in six monthly installments to the address of the final subsidy check.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>In addition to the initial letter given to adoptive parents/guardians at the time the subsidy agreement is being signed, a letter will be sent from Central Office to the youth shortly before the subsidy will end. This letter will remind the youth that the Department will be sending the money in six monthly installments to the youth in the month immediately following the month the subsidy ends. &nbsp;The letter will also contain a phone number to call in order to report any change of address. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>In addition to informing the youth about the incentive payment, the letter will also inform the youth of the availability of housing advocacy services and assistance with financial planning and budgeting. &nbsp;A phone number and contact person will be identified for these services.</li></ul><p><strong>IV. LETTERS</strong></p><p>The letters to be given to adoptive parents and guardians are the CFS 470-5 for Adoption Assistance and the CFS 482-6 for Subsidized Guardianship. Both letters are attached. The letters, which are being translated into Spanish, will be available in Central Stores and as a SACWIS template.

Although eligibility for adoption assistance shall be determined regardless of the financial circumstances of the adoptive parents, the types and amounts of assistance under each adoption assistance agreement shall be determined by the Department and the adoptive parents on an individual basis. The Department shall take into consideration the specific circumstances of the adoptive parents and any special care needs of the child being adopted as described in subsection (b)(2) of this Section. The types of adoption assistance that may be provided include:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">one-time only payments of non-recurring adoption expenses incurred by or on behalf of the adoptive parents in connection with the adoption of a special needs child, up to a maximum of $1500 for each adopted child;</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">payments for physical, emotional and mental health needs not wholly payable through insurance or other public resources that are associated with or result from a condition whose onset has been established as occurring prior to the completion of the adoption.

However, while payments may be increased based on changes in the level of care the child needs, payments will not be decreased based on changes in the level of care. In no event shall the monthly adoption assistance payment be greater than the applicable licensed foster family care payment level;</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">an incentive payment of $3000 for children who are 14 to 18 years of age when adopted during the time period of March 15, 2001 through June 30, 2002.

A documented search for alternative adoptive placements without adoption assistance shall be made unless the Department determines that such a search is against the best interests of the child because the child has developed significant emotional ties with the prospective adoptive parents while in their foster care.</p></li></ol></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Adoption assistance as a one-time only payment for non-recurring adoption expenses shall be provided to parents adopting a child who is determined by the Department to have special needs as provided in subsection (b) of this section. This includes expenses incurred by or on behalf of such parents, in connection with the adoption of a special needs child, either directly or through another public or private agency. These expenses include reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses that are directly related to the legal adoption of a child with special needs and that are not incurred in violation of State or Federal law. The amount of payments to be made in any specific case shall be determined by the needs of the child being adopted and the availability of pro bono services, and shall not exceed $1500 per adoptive child. The adoptive parents may refuse any or all payments available under this subsection (c) of this Section.</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Adoption assistance for ongoing monthly payments and medical assistance may be provided to parents adopting a child who:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">is determined by the Department to have special needs as provided in subsection (b) of this Section; and</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">meets one of the following conditions:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">was eligible at the time the adoption petition was filed for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) under the provisions of Title IV-A of the Social Security Act in effect as of July 16, 1996; or</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">was eligible for foster care maintenance payments under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act at the time the adoption petition was filed; or</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">was eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) prior to finalization of the adoption; or</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">is a child for whom the Department of Children and Family Services was legally responsible when the adoption petition was filed; and</p></li></ol></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">in all cases, other than a child determined to have special needs under subsection (b)(2) of this Section because of a documented physical, mental, or emotional disability, the child has been in the care of the Department or another agency or person other than his or her parents pursuant to an order of the court for at least one year prior to the adoption unless the child is being adopted after October 1, 1997 and is a child who had previously been adopted with adoption assistance, but the adoption was dissolved and the parental rights of the adoptive parents were terminated, or the adoptive parents have died. However, the one year placement requirement is not applicable for sibling groups where at least one sibling is determined to be special needs because of a documented physical, mental, or emotional disability and meets all requirements for adoption assistance.</p></li></ol></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The Department shall make an initial determination whether to provide ongoing monthly payments and the amount of the payment in each individual case by taking into consideration the circumstances of the adoptive parents and the needs, age, and type of placement of the child being adopted as adjusted for any benefits the child will be receiving, such as Social Security, Veterans’ benefits, railroad retirement or black lung benefits. Supplemental Security benefits (SSI) are not to be considered in the determination of the ongoing monthly payment. If a child is receiving SSI, the receipt of adoption assistance is taken into consideration by the Social Security Administration when calculating the amount of the SSI benefit.</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">In cases where the determination under subsection (b)(2) of this Section is based on a diagnosis that the child may eventually require care for a documented medical condition or disability related to pre-existing physical, mental, or emotional conditions or risk factors that do not yet require treatment at the time of the adoption, no such payments shall be made at that time. The adoption assistance agreement may provide that such payments be initiated when the child's pre-existing condition or identified risk factors warrant treatment or professional intervention. If such payments are commenced, the ongoing monthly payment shall in no event exceed the amount the child would receive if the child was in foster care at the time the payments are initiated.</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The adoption assistance agreement providing for ongoing monthly payments and medical assistance shall include an agreement with the adoptive parents that the amount of any ongoing monthly payments shall be reviewed at least every two years and may be readjusted every two years or more frequently, based on changes in the circumstances of the adoptive parents and the needs of the child being adopted. However, while payments may be increased based on changes in the level of care that the child needs, payments will not be decreased based on changes in the level of care. If the adoptive parents or the adopted child disagree with the Department’s determination, they may appeal the determination in accordance with 89 Ill. Adm. Code 337 (Service Appeal Process). Adoptive parents may refuse any or all payments offered by the Department.</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">A prospective adoptive family being presented with a child determined to be a special needs child shall be made aware of the availability of adoption assistance and the types of adoption assistance and, in the case of ongoing monthly adoption assistance payments, that such payments are subject to review at least every two years and may be terminated or readjusted based on subsections (i) and (j). In order to receive adoption assistance, the child must be placed in the adoptive home and the adoption assistance agreement signed prior to finalization of the adoption.</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The type(s), amount and duration of adoption assistance shall be agreed to in writing by the Department and the adoptive parent(s) prior to the finalization of the adoption, and shall be set forth in the adoption assistance agreement, which shall be binding on the parties to the agreement. The agreement shall also stipulate that the agreement shall remain in effect regardless of the state where the adoptive parents reside currently or in the future and shall contain provisions for the protection of the interests of the child in cases where the adoptive parents and child move to another state while the agreement is in effect. The duration of adoption assistance may extend until age 18 years, or until age 19 years if the child is still in high school, although adoption assistance may be provided at the Department's option until the child's 21st birthday if the child has a physical, mental or emotional disability that warrants the continuation of assistance. The adoptive parents or the adoptive child may appeal the Department’s decision to discontinue adoption assistance at age 18 or 19 for a child still in high school.</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The adoptive parent shall notify the Department as soon as practically possible in writing of a change in address or when the following changes occur which will affect the amount of adoption assistance:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">the child is no longer the legal responsibility of the adoptive parent;</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">the child is no longer receiving financial support from the adoptive parent;</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">the child’s condition has changed to the extent that, if the child were in foster care, an increase in the child’s level of care would be required; or</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">a change has occurred in the circumstances of the family that is relevant in determining the amount of assistance payments. Such circumstances pertain to the parents’ ability to incorporate the child into their household in relation to their standard of living, future plans and overall capacity to meet the immediate and future needs of the child.</p></li></ol></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The Department will provide a payment of $3000 to be awarded to an adopted child under the following circumstances in the manner described:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">In order to assist youth who have been adopted to make the transition to adulthood, the Department will provide a payment of $3000 directly to the youth upon termination of his or her adoption subsidy.</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The payment is intended to assist the child’s transition to adulthood by helping pay for education, housing, or other forms of vocational training or employment assistance.</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">In order to be eligible for this payment, the child:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">must have been the legal responsibility of the Department prior to the adoption; and</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">must have been 14 to18 years of age when adopted, during the time period of March 15, 2001 through June 30, 2002.</p></li></ol></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Children in adoptive placements within this time period who do not have their adoptions finalized by June 30, 2002 will not be eligible for this grant award.</p></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The payment will be awarded directly to the child.</p></li></ol></li><li><p class=\"text-align-justify\">If an adoption is dissolved because of the termination of the parental rights of the adoptive parents or the death of the adoptive parents, a child adopted with adoption assistance continues to be eligible for such assistance if he or she is adopted again on or after October 1, 1997.</p></li></ol><p class=\"text-align-justify\">(Source: Amended at 25 Ill.

However, if a child younger than 12 years of age is living in the home of a non-relative and has no older sibling for whom subsidized guardianship is being considered, the worker must determine that subsidized guardianship is in the child’s best interests due to the length of time the child has been in the home, the age of the child, characteristics, limitations, and responsibilities including health and mobility of the caretakers or the special needs of the child. The basis for the best interest decision must be documented, and must be approved by the Department Guardianship Administrator.</li><li>The child must have a strong attachment to the potential guardian and the guardian must have a strong commitment to the child.</li><li>Reunification efforts of the child with his or her family must have been ruled out despite reasonable efforts having been made to reunite the child with his or her parents as documented in the case record.</li><li>Adoption must have been ruled out as a permanency goal for the child.</li><li>The parents may consent to the subsidized guardianship arrangement or the Department may proceed, for good cause, to seek a private guardian without parental consent provided that notice is given of the guardianship petition hearing in accordance with Section 11-10.1(a) of the Probate Act [755 ILCS 5/11-10.1].</li><li>A child 14 years of age or older must consent to the initiation of the subsidized guardianship living arrangement.</li><li>The prospective guardian must have no record of any felony convictions.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Responsibilities of the Private Subsidized Guardian</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Private guardians are responsible for ensuring that parents have the opportunity to visit their children in accordance with the provisions/orders of the court.</li><li>Private guardians shall notify the Department as soon as practically possible in writing when the following changes occur which may affect the amount of the subsidy:<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li>the child is no longer the legal responsibility of the subsidized guardian;</li><li>the child is no longer receiving financial support from the subsidized guardian;</li><li>a change has occurred in the circumstances of the family that is relevant in determining the amount of assistance payments; or</li><li>there is a change of address.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>Responsibilities of Department</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Prior to approving a subsidized guardianship arrangement for a child, the Department shall determine whether subsidized guardianship is in the best interests of the child.

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to issue instructions to staff for the initiative to increase the number of relatives that are licensed as foster family homes and to increase the number of children in relative care to achieve permanency.</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>The primary users of this Policy Guide are DCFS and purchase of service (POS) agency child welfare workers and licensing staff and DCFS child welfare and family development staff.</p><p><strong>III. BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>On July 3, 2001, the Administration for Children and Families of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a policy announcement clarifying that states may no longer claim federal Title IV-E funds for the administrative costs associated with serving children in unlicensed relative care placements. &nbsp;This means a potential loss in the federal match for the cost of providing case management services to children placed with relatives who have not been licensed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To minimize any loss of federal funds, the Department is implementing an initiative to increase the number of relatives who become licensed foster parents and to increase the number of children in relative care who &nbsp;achieve permanency. &nbsp;The initiative will be implemented in the Department and purchase of service agencies. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IV. DEFINITIONS</strong></p><p>For purposes of this process, an “unlicensed relative” is a related caregiver who <strong>does not hold a valid foster home license or permit</strong> at the time the child is placed. &nbsp;It also includes licensed foster homes with related children in placement where the licensees become unlicensed because they surrender their license, or fail to submit a renewal application, or fail to complete the licensing process and the pending renewal application expires. The related caregiver may have had prior licensing history, but does not currently hold a valid license or permit.&nbsp;</p><p>“Clean-up group” means relative caregiver homes that are not licensed at the time that the Home of Relative Licensing and Permanency Initiative begins.&nbsp;</p><p>“On-going group” means relative caregiver homes that accept their first placement - - or the placement is data entered - - &nbsp;after November 1, 2001. &nbsp;This group also includes licensed foster homes with related children in placement where the licensees become unlicensed because they surrender their license, or fail to submit a renewal application, or fail to complete the licensing process and the pending renewal application expires. &nbsp;</p><p>“Licensing worker” means a POS licensing representative or a DCFS family development specialist.</p><p>\"Complete application for foster family home license\" means a completed written application form; written authorization by the applicant and all adult members of the applicant's household to conduct a criminal background investigation; medical evidence in the form of a medical report, on forms prescribed by the Department, that the applicant and all members of the household are free from communicable diseases or physical and mental conditions that affect their ability to provide care for the child or children; the names and addresses of at least 3 persons not related to the applicant who can attest to the applicant's moral character; and fingerprints submitted by the applicant and all adult members of the applicant's household. [225 ILCS 10/4]&nbsp;</p><p>“HMR Coordinator” means the Home of Relative Coordinator in the Central Office of Licensing. &nbsp;This individual is responsible for tracking assignments, resolving problems, and reporting progress to the Director and others.</p><p><strong>V. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION</strong></p><p>Each DCFS region and POS agency shall appoint a Home of Relative (HMR) Liaison to facilitate quick and consistent communication between the agency or region and the DCFS Central Office of Licensing (CooL). &nbsp;The CooL will appoint a staff person to serve as the HMR Coordinator. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li><strong>Clean-up Group Process&nbsp;</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><p><strong>Clean-up Group Lists&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The CooL HMR Coordinator shall forward to each region or POS agency contact person a list of the relative caregiver homes in the Clean-up Group by November 15, 2001.&nbsp;</p><p>A copy of each POS agency’s list will also be sent to the appropriate DCFS Agency Performance Teams (APT).&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Assign Home to Licensing Worker</strong></p><p>Within 3 business days of receiving the final Clean-Up Group list from the HMR Coordinator, the DCFS region or POS agency shall assign a licensing worker to the home.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Make Appointment for Home Visit&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Within 5 business days of being assigned to the home, the licensing worker shall contact the related caregivers (by telephone whenever possible) and make an appointment for a home visit to discuss the benefits of getting licensed, explain the licensing process, and answer any questions the relative might have.&nbsp;</p><p>If the licensing worker is unable to contact the related caregivers by telephone, the licensing representative shall send a letter via certified mail to the related caregivers and maintain a copy of the letter.</p><p>The initial home visit shall occur no later than 10 business days after the licensing worker has contacted the caregivers to make the appointment, unless the related caregivers cannot meet sooner. If the visit does not occur within 10 days, the licensing worker shall document, in writing, the reason for the delay in the initial home visit.</p></li><li><strong>Make Initial Home Visit &nbsp;</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li><p><strong>Discussion/Explanation</strong></p><p>During the initial home visit, the licensing worker shall discuss/explain the following:&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>the caregivers’ role in becoming a permanency resource for the child(ren);&nbsp;</li><li>the benefits of getting licensed (including the difference in payment);&nbsp;</li><li>permanency options other than reunification that may become appropriate for the children (e.g., adoption and guardianship);&nbsp;</li><li>licensing requirements, including space, background checks, health examinations, training;

FILING INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>POLICY GUIDE 2001.16</strong><br><strong>APPENDIX A</strong></p><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>INITIAL ASSIGNMENT OF LEAD LICENSING RESPONSIBILITY</strong></p><p>Unlicensed relative caregivers were initially assigned to a DCFS region or a POS agency for the purpose of lead responsibility for licensing work based on the following approach:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Current living arrangement type and type service code for children placed with caregiver;</li><li>Verification that the caregiver resides in Illinois (ie. Out-of-state caregivers were excluded);</li><li>Verification that the caregiver has no current licensing history (licensed, application pending or a pending renewal)</li><li>Verification of which agency is getting paid for case management for the children placed in the home (i.e. who is associated for payment purposes with the provider ID number of the caregiver serving the child(ren) as recorded in the Department’s provider database If the “pay to” data element on the MARS PR 02 screen was blank, it was presumed that the caregiver was supervised by DCFS.</li></ul><p>If only one agency is being paid, the home was assigned for the purpose of lead licensing responsibility to that agency.</p><p>If multiple agencies were involved in serving children placed with the caregiver, then the assignment of the home was determined by application of the following criteria:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Past licensing history;</li><li>Agency with the most children placed in the home;</li><li>If case management of children in the home was equally split between involved agencies, the Agency serving the oldest child;</li><li>If children in the home are the same age, the agency serving the child who has been in placement the longest.</li></ul><p>The LAN in which the caregiver’s home is located was then determined by the Department using the caregiver’s mailing address:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>DCFS homes were assigned to the appropriate region and Licensing Team.</li><li>POS Homes were assigned to the appropriate POS agency.</li></ul><p>Each DCFS region and POS agency was asked to complete any necessary data clean-up of preliminary lists by no later than September 26, 2001. The cleanup included:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Correcting as necessary caregiver (i.e. provider) information such as mailing or location address; and/or</li><li>Correcting information concerning case management assignment of any child who is listed on the reports as being placed with the caregiver.</li></ul><p>This data clean-up was essential because the Department produced in early October and distributed to all POS agencies and DCFS regions a “final” list of what will be referred to as the “clean-up” group of caregiver’s/homes. On all future unlicensed caregiver reports produced for DCFS and POS agencies, the “clean-up” group of caregivers will be identifiable by the date on which the caregiver first appeared on the report.</p><p>The list produced in early November 2001 will be the baseline for monitoring and measuring the performance of DCFS regions and POS agencies in successfully getting relative caregivers licensed as foster parents.<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>POLICY GUIDE 2001.16</strong><br><strong>APPENDIX B</strong></p><p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>HOME OF RELATIVE LICENSING AND PERMANENCY INITIATIVE</strong><br><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</strong></p><p>This document provides answers to frequently asked questions related to the Department Home of Relative Licensing and Permanency Initiative begun in State Fiscal Year 2002.</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><p><strong>What procedures should an agency (DCFS or POS) follow if they think a relative caregiver has two different provider numbers?</strong></p><p>A caregiver may have multiple provider ID numbers. A provider ID number may or may not have a child associated with that number that an agency (POS or DCFS) is supervising. For licensing purposes, the agency should use an ID number associated with one of the children for whom they are providing case management services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Will the Department provide any financial assistance to relative caregivers to cover or offset any costs a caregiver might incur to meet foster home licensing standards?</strong></p><p>The Department does not make any financial assistance available to cover or offset any costs a caregiver might incur to <strong>meet foster home licensing standards</strong> as described in DCFS Rule 402, Foster Family Home Licensing Standards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Does the Department plan to make available more Spanish sessions of training required for licensure?</strong></p><p>Yes. The Department provides training in Spanish whenever needed. A class can be scheduled whenever seven (7) or more participants are identified. Further, individual training can be scheduled to accommodate unusual circumstances. Agencies are advised to continue to use the current procedure: work with the local community college approved to provide Foster/Pride training by notifying them of the need for classes in Spanish. Please notify the Division of Training and Development Services by calling 217-785-5689.</p></li><li><p><strong>Must licensing staff contact an unlicensed relative caregiver who is caring for only one child and the child is age 18 or older?</strong></p><p>Yes. The caregiver must be contacted and must be given the opportunity to decide whether or not they want to pursue licensure as a foster home. The caregiver’s decision must be recorded on the “Confirmation of Interest in Foster Home Licensure” form and faxed to the Central Office of Licensing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Some POS agencies have been approved by the Department to provide their own foster parent training rather than using the “Foster/Adopt Pride” training curriculum. What procedures should the POS agencies follow-up to revise their curriculum and obtain the Department’s approval?</strong></p><p>Agencies will need to revise their current curriculum to accommodate the new changes in foster care provider training. These changes include:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>Pre-licensure foster care provider training must be the same for related and unrelated caregivers;</li><li>Pre-licensure training must be limited to no more than six hours and must include the Foster Parent Handbook;</li><li>Following licensure, both related and unrelated caregivers must participate in six hours of mandatory Education Advocacy;</li><li>Additional pre-placement training is recommended for all. Each agency may design pre-placement training and/or additional support training covering required elements contained in Foster/Pride. Pre-placement or additional support training would be voluntary for the related caregiver. Unrelated caregivers would be required to attend the program designed and approved by the agency prior to accepting an unrelated child for placement;</li><li>Related and unrelated caregivers are required to comply with continuing education requirements for renewal</li></ul><p>In accordance with Rule 402, each agency is required to submit its revised training program for approval by the Department. Programs may be sent to the Division of Training and Development. The review is based on current best practice roles, responsibilities and requirements for all caregivers. The approval process will be expedited to accommodate current requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Does DCFS intend to reduce the amount of administrative payment to POS agencies for children placed with unlicensed relatives?</strong></p><p>No reduction in the administrative payment rate to POS agencies for children placed with unlicensed relatives is contemplated at this time. However, this decision may change in the future depending on an agency’s performance/compliance with established procedures governing licensing work with unlicensed relative caregivers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Before the 1995 HMR reform effort, some current unlicensed relative caregivers completed 6hours of training that was required for the caregiver be approved as meeting licensing standards. Will these caregivers be required to complete the new 6 hours of pre-licensure training?</strong></p><p>Yes, the caregivers will be required to complete the new 6 hours of licensure training if they choose to pursue licensure as a foster family home and serve related children. They will also have to complete 6 hours of training on educational advocacy within 12 months of becoming licensed.<br>If the licensed caregiver decides subsequently that she/he wants to also care for unrelated children, the caregiver will need to complete an additional 21 hours of training before being able to accept an unrelated child for care.</p></li><li><p><strong>Does the Department plan to send a letter to all unlicensed relative caregivers to inform them of the Department’s initiative?</strong></p><p>Yes. The Department plans to send a letter to all unlicensed caregivers. The letter will be in English and Spanish. DCFS Regions and POS agencies will be notified when the letter is mailed and also will be provided a copy of the letter.</p></li><li><p><strong>How frequently will caseworkers be expected to make an in-person visit to the home of an unlicensed caregiver?</strong></p><p>The caseworker who has case management responsibility for a child who is placed with an unlicensed caregiver will be expected to make an in-home visit to the caregiver’s home at least twice a month until it is determined that the caregiver does not want to become licensed or that the caregiver cannot be licensed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Will DCFS modify the actual foster home license to indicate on it whether a foster parent may care for related children only or for both related and unrelated children?</strong></p><p>The Department has no plans to modify the actual foster home license. However, the Central Office of Licensing will maintain such information and provide it the Department’s Placement Clearance Desk (PCD).</p><p>PCD staff will use the information as part of the process by which it approves or disapproves a child’s placement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Will any changes be made to the Individual License Summary (ILS) due to this initiative?</strong></p><p>No changes to the ILS are contemplated</p></li><li><p><strong>Will the changes being made regarding the number of hours of training required before licensure or the number of hours required before being able to care for an unrelated child have any impact on the training requirements for a person who is adopting an unrelated child for whom DCFS has no legal responsibility?</strong></p><p>No</p></li><li><p><strong>What do I do if a child is on my report for whom we are no longer providing case management services?</strong></p><p>Call the appropriate regional 906 Hotline/business office or Cook County Case Assignment Placement Unit (312-808-5160) to verify the placement changes have occurred and the child is NO longer your responsibility.</p></li><li><p><strong>What do I do if a home is on my report and all of the children have moved to a different foster home?</strong></p><p>Call the appropriate regional 906Hotline/ business office or the Cook County Case Assignment and Placement Unit (312-808-5160) to verify the move to the new placement has occurred.</p></li><li><p><strong>What do I do if a home is on my report and I think it is licensed or has an application pending in process?</strong></p><p>Call the HMR Coordinator in the Central Office of Licensing at 217-785-2688 to confirm the licensing status of the caregiver.</p></li><li><p><strong>What do I do if a home is on my report and I don’t know the caregiver or any of the children?</strong></p><p>Call the Central Office Client Payment Unit at 217-525-0499, Option 2 for resolution.</p></li><li><p><strong>What do I do if we have children on different provider ID numbers on the report?</strong></p><p>Nothing should be done. This does not create any problem(s).</p></li><li><p><strong>What if the name of the caregiver on the report is incorrect or is spelled wrong?</strong></p><p>Call the Central Office Client Payment Unit in Springfield at 217-525-0499, Option 2. They will correct the spelling and may request that the caregiver complete, sign, and submit a new “Request for Taxpayer Identification and Certification (W-9 form).</p></li><li><p><strong>What if the address of the caregiver is incorrect?</strong></p><p>Call your regional 906 business office or Case Assignment and Placement Unit (Cook County) to have the location address changed. They will need to know if the new address is where they want their mail to be sent.</p></li><li><p><strong>What is the advantage of my adopting or becoming a guardian of my teenage relatives?</strong></p><p>If the child is adopted or guardianship is finalized by June 30, 2002 and the child is at least 14 years old but not yet 18 at finalization, upon emancipation from adoption or guardianship the Department will pay the child $500 per month for 6 months for a total of $3,000 to begin their independence.</p></li><li><p><strong>If the relative child has not been in foster care for two years, how can I obtain guardianship?</strong></p><p>The guardianship rules have recently changed. The child has to be in DCFS custody for a year and in your care for a year to qualify for subsidized guardianship.</p></li><li><p><strong>What if a caregiver is on my list with 2 different social security numbers or the social security number is not correct?</strong></p><p>Validate which social security number is correct and call The Central Office Client Payment Unit at 217-525-0499 option 2 for the correction. CPU will correct the data system and will mail a “Request for Taxpayer Identification and Certification (W-9 form) to the caregiver for completion and submittal back to the Department.</p></li><li><p><strong>Will a relative who gets licensed as a foster home be able to care for a related child who has been determined by Level of Care procedures to require a specialized care and receive a higher payment for providing care to the child?</strong></p><p>Yes, provided that the child’s eligibility for specialized care has been determined according to the Department’s Level of Care approval procedures as contained in Policy Guide 2001.03.</p></li><li><p><strong>Does a related caregiver have to do anything more than get 6 hours of training to qualify for a license?</strong></p><p>Yes! The relative caregiver will have to meet all of the requirements for foster home licensure, i.e., comply with the standards in Rule 402, Licensing Standards for Foster Family Homes.</p></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p>\n <div class=\"hasviewmode mode-default\">\n  \n\n                <img loading=\"lazy\"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p><strong>I. Purpose</strong></p><p>Please replace the first two pages of Policy Guide 2001.17 with these corrected pages. The correction, which appears at the bottom of page two, changes the threshold for compliance to six visits in a six-month period, not six visits per year.</p><p>Child welfare best practice and long standing Department policy have underscored the need to provide for regular contact between siblings who cannot be placed together – to maintain family relationships and mitigate against the separation and loss experienced by children who are removed from their homes. During fiscal year 2002, the Department will initiate penalties on Department regions and Purchase of Service agencies that are found to be out of significant compliance with the visitation requirements of the Aristotle P. Consent Decree. All assigned caseworkers and their supervisors are expected to ensure that sibling visitation occurs.</p><p><strong>II. Primary Users</strong></p><p>The primary users of these procedures are placement and follow-up staff of the Department and Purchase of Service agencies.</p><p><strong>III. Key Words</strong></p><p>Aristotle P, compliance monitoring, sanctions, sibling visitation, visiting plan.</p><p><strong>IV. Background</strong></p><p>In compliance with the Aristotle P. Consent Decree, placement staff of the Department and purchase of service agencies must make all reasonable efforts to place siblings together. When siblings cannot be placed together as allowed under the conditions stated in <strong>Rule 301.70</strong>, sibling visitation must occur in compliance with <strong>Rules 301.220</strong> and <strong>301.230</strong>.</p><p><strong>V. Monitoring Tools</strong></p><p>The Department has established statewide systems to monitor compliance with all Sibling Placement and Visitation Rules on a case by case basis. The purchase of service agency or Department Region will face sanctions as defined below when it is determined by one or more of these systems that Sibling Visitation is non-compliant with the requirements of <strong>Rule 301.220</strong>.</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li><p><strong>Statewide ACR Feedback Reports</strong></p><p>As part of the routine case review, ACR reviewers will generate feedback reports identifying sibling visitation non-compliance. ACR staff will continue to data enter the feedback issue on the ACR database, and provide reports to DCFS-QA staff who will initiate contact with the responsible supervisor to resolve the visitation issue.</p><p>During Fiscal Year 2002, ACR reviewers will produce a feedback report for all cases, and will note if sibling visits have occurred less than six times during the previous six months and there is no documentation that sibling visits have been ruled out per the stipulations of the Aristotle P. Consent Decree listed below:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>court has ordered that sibling visits occur less frequently or not at all;</li><li>the child has stated that he or she does not want to visit with his or her siblings, and has been counseled about the importance of maintaining family ties;</li><li>one sibling may physically, mentally, or emotionally harm another during the visit, and supervision would be inadequate to eliminate the risk of such harm; or</li><li>the child is placed in a residential facility more than 150 miles away from his/her siblings.</li></ul><p>In order to verify that visits are occurring in accordance with the visiting plan the worker will be required to submit case notes and/or other documentation during the review regarding the dates the visits took place and observations/reports about the content of the visits. Appropriate documentation may include: <strong>DCFS Visiting Record (CFS-502)</strong>, <strong>Sibling Visitation Form (CFS-315)</strong>, and/or <strong>Case Entry Notes (CFS-492)</strong>.</p><p>The threshold for compliance will be increased in future fiscal years. The FY02 threshold is six visits during a six-month period.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cook County Help Unit Staffing Reports</strong></p><p>Cases brought to the Help Unit’s attention by judges or other court personnel suggest significant negligence in visitation. Cases referred for/with identified sibling visitation issues will be subject to sanctions, and will be noted via the Help Unit’s monthly tracking report.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cook County Sibling Placement Protocol Documentation (Policy Guide 2001.18.</strong></p><p>As required by Policy Guide 2000.16 sibling groups that are not placed together within thirty days of assignment are subject to a sanction if the assigned agency does not provide documentation of a diligent search and/or clinical reasons that prevent consolidated placement. The policy requests that a copy of a sibling visitation plan be included with documentation of the split placement. Failure to submit a current sibling visitation plan and/or documentation of the split placement will be subject to contract sanctions.</p></li></ol><p><strong>VI. Agency/Region Notification of Non-Compliance</strong></p><p>On a monthly basis, the DCFS-Performance Contract team will receive reports from the DCFS-Division of Quality Assurance, ACR, and the Cook County Help Unit identifying cases which are out of visitation compliance with the Aristotle P. Consent Decree as noted above. For each case, all assigned DCFS Regional Administrators and/or POS Executive Directors will receive written notice of the non-compliance and sanction. The DCFS region and/or POS agency will be given thirty days from the date of the letter to request a review of the sanction. If, after thirty days, no request for review is submitted, the sanction will be carried out during the following month. If a request for review is submitted, no sanction will be issued until a decision on the request for review is made by DCFS.</p><p><strong>VII. Agency/Region Request for Review Process</strong></p><p>Agency Executive Directors and DCFS Regional Administrators will, on a monthly basis, receive a letter identifying those cases for which the agency will receive sanctions. The agency/region may request a review of the proposed sanction in writing only if one of the following criteria is met:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li>During the previous six months, sibling visits were not appropriate due to one of the following reasons:<ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>court has ordered that sibling visits occur less frequently or not at all;</li><li>the child has stated that he or she does not want to visit with his or her siblings, and has been counseled about the importance of maintaining family ties;</li><li>one sibling may physically, mentally, or emotionally harm another during the visit, and supervision would be inadequate to eliminate the risk of such harm; or</li><li>the child is placed in a residential facility more than 150 miles away from his/her siblings.</li></ul></li><li>The agency/region can provide documentation that <em>good faith attempts were made to schedule</em> sibling visits, but visits did not occur despite the worker’s <em>due diligence</em>.<br>A DCFS Visiting Record (<strong>CFS-502</strong>), Sibling Visitation Form (<strong>CFS-315</strong>), and/or Case Entry Notes (<strong>CFS-492</strong>) signed by a supervisor should be utilized in documenting these efforts.</li></ol><p>Any request for review will be reviewed by the DCFS Office of the Executive Deputy Director within ten days of receipt. The DCFS Regional Administrator and/or POS Executive Director will be notified of the review decision in writing within twenty days of submission of the request for review.</p><p><strong>VIII. Potential Sanctions</strong></p><p>When necessary, sanctions will be imposed on all agencies responsible for case management of at least one child case within a sibling cluster. Sanctions will be issued only once during any six month ACR cycle for a child. If the case is not found to be in compliance at the next routinely scheduled ACR, a second sanction may be issued and the case will be considered for transfer.</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li><p><strong>Traditional/Relative/Specialized/Treatment Foster Care</strong></p><p>Financial penalties will be levied every six months for non-compliant child cases. Agencies will be penalized one quarter of the agency’s annual administrative rate for each child they serve. Cases will not be re-penalized unless a second report is issued for non-compliance during a subsequent six-month period.&nbsp;</p><p>Example:</p><p>Agency ABC is serving two siblings in Cook Traditional; Agency X is serving their sibling (one child in Specialized Foster Care in a different home). The case has been identified as non-compliant with the Aristotle P. Consent Decree because the three children are in separate placements and no visitation has occurred during the previous six-months. During the regularly scheduled ACR, a feedback report was completed with sibling visitation as a chronic issue.</p><p>Agency ABC will be charged a quarter of their annual administrative rate for each of the children they serve:</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Agency monthly admin per child</td><td>$569.33</td><td>BAT rate</td></tr><tr><td>Annualized per child admin rate</td><td>$6,831.96</td><td>($569.33 x 12 months)</td></tr><tr><td>Quarter of annual admin payment</td><td>$1,707.99</td><td>($6831.96 / 4)</td></tr><tr><td>Number of children served by Agency ABC</td><td>2</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Total Agency ABC penalty&nbsp;</td><td>$3,415.98</td><td>($1,707.99x 2 children)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Agency X will be charged a quarter of their annual administrative rate for the child they serve:</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Agency monthly admin per child</td><td>$762.50&nbsp;</td><td>($25 x 30.5 days)</td></tr><tr><td>Annualized per child admin rate</td><td>$9,150.00</td><td>($762.50 x 12 months)</td></tr><tr><td>Quarter of annual admin payment</td><td>$2,287.50&nbsp;</td><td>($9,150.00 / 4)</td></tr><tr><td>Number of children served by Agency X</td><td>1</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Total Agency X penalty&nbsp;</td><td>$2,287.50</td><td>($2,287.50 x 1 child)</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li><p><strong>DCFS Managed Foster Care Cases</strong></p><p>Foster care cases with feedback reports from the above monitoring sources and involving DCFS regional case management will be transferred to a compliant DCFS team or POS agency and appropriate disciplinary action may be initiated. Non-compliant child cases managed by a DCFS team will be consolidated to the sibling’s POS agency. If the entire sibling group is managed by the Department, the entire family case will be transferred to a compliant team or POS agency. Case transfer will be initiated on a monthly basis by Department staff.</p></li><li><p><strong>DCFS Managed non-Foster Care cases</strong></p><p>For child cases managed by DCFS teams per policy (i.e. ILO, Detention, Group Home placements), and in which sibling visitation is non-compliant, the assigned worker and supervisor may be subject to disciplinary action. These cases will be identified through the same monitoring tools and reported on a monthly basis.</p></li></ol><p><strong>IX. Compliance</strong></p><p>The Department Regions and Purchase of Service agencies will be given a four-month time period during which they are expected to bring their caseload into compliance. Although the monitoring process detailed in this procedure will begin November 1, 2001, non-compliant cases will not be sanctioned until February 2002.</p><p>The Department will closely monitor compliance with this and all other sibling protocols. Non-compliance with the Aristotle P. Consent Decree may result in Agency Performance corrective action up to and including intake hold.</p><p><strong>X. Questions</strong></p><p>If you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact Melissa Ludington at 312-814-6800.</p><p><strong>XI. Filing Instructions</strong></p><p>Place this Policy Guide with Rule Section 301.220, Sibling Visitation.</p>\n  </div>"

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to reissue a revised Policy Guide 2000.16 which was issued on November 21, 2000 with an effective date of December 1, 2000. Policy Guide 2000.16 addressed how sibling cases in Cook County are assigned to purchase of service (POS) agencies and the requirements of agencies to place siblings together from the point of assignment. The protocol was developed in partnership with Cook County Purchase of Service staff to assist agency compliance with the Aristotle P. Consent Decree. This revised Policy Guide adds a requirement to submit documentation of the sibling visitation plan to the DCFS Division of POS Monitoring when siblings cannot be placed together.</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>The primary users of these procedures are placement staff of the Department and Purchase of Service agencies.</p><p><strong>III. KEY WORDS</strong></p><p>Case Assignment Placement Unit (CAPU), sibling placements, Secondary Match System.</p><p><strong>IV. BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>In compliance with the Aristotle P. Consent Decree, the Department and case management agencies must make all reasonable efforts to place siblings together. Additional information on Sibling Placements may be found in DCFS <strong>Rule and Procedure 301.70</strong>.</p><p><strong>V. REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p>Purchase of Service Agencies are expected to provide immediate placement for traditional cases at the time of assignment, which may require the agency to recruit and develop emergency and traditional foster homes with the capacity for sibling groups.</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li><p><strong>Sibling Groups of Three or Fewer</strong></p><p>For new cases of three or fewer siblings, assignments will be based on the geographic process described in the Cook County Case Assignment Protocol. The assigned agency will be expected to identify one placement to accommodate all siblings. The assignment process will follow this order:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>The assigned agency must be able to verify the ability to place the sibling group together within one hour of notification by the Case Assignment Placement Unit (CAPU).</li><li>If the agency is unable to place the sibling group together, the case will be re-rotated to another agency. The case will be rotated to a maximum of three agencies.</li><li>If the third agency is unable to place the sibling group together, the Case Assignment Placement Unit (CAPU) will refer the case to a Department contracted sibling program.</li><li>If the contracted sibling program is unable to accept the case, the assignment will remain with the initial agency.</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to provide a placement for all siblings together, the case must be posted on the Secondary Match System within <strong>five</strong> days of assignment. It is the responsibility of the assigned agency to conduct a diligent search for a foster home for all siblings within 30 days of assignment, in compliance with DCFS Rule 301.70, and provide sibling contact and visitation in compliance with DCFS Rules 301.220 and 301.230.<br>When a placement is identified with another agency, case management responsibility will be transferred to the licensing agency unless the transfer is clinically contraindicated as determined by the Office of the Executive Deputy Director.</li><li><p>If the assigned agency is unable to locate a placement for all siblings within <strong>30</strong> days, documentation of the diligent search and/or documentation of clinical reasons that prevent placement together must be submitted to the DCFS-Division of POS Monitoring. Sufficient documentation may include one or more of the following:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li>Print-out of the child profile screen and broadcast results from the Secondary Match System;</li><li>Copies of Payment-Placement Authorization form (CFS 906);</li><li>Copies of approved and/or submitted Level of Care;</li><li>Copies of approved and/or submitted PRT;</li><li>Psychological evaluation;</li><li>SACY safety plans;</li><li>Clinical staffing notes signed by a supervisor; and/or</li><li>Completed 30-day comprehensive assessment.</li></ol><p>If the assigned agency is unable to provide sufficient documentation or demonstrate reasonable efforts within 30 days of assignment, the agency will maintain case management but will receive a contract deduction for inability to place.</p></li><li>If after a diligent search, the agency is unable to place the sibling group together, documentation of the sibling visitation plan must be submitted to the DCFS-Division of POS Monitoring.<br>Documentation should minimally include:<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li>Copies of the Client Service Plan- Visiting Plan (<strong>CFS-497, Part IIA</strong>).</li><li>Copies of completed DCFS Visiting Records (<strong>CFS-502</strong>), and/or Sibling Visitation Forms (<strong>CFS-315</strong>).</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>Sibling Groups of Four or More</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><strong>Referrals to Department Contracted Sibling Programs</strong><br>New cases of four or more siblings should be considered for identified Department contracted sibling programs. CAPU will determine if the case meets the program eligibility requirements and will contact the designated intake liaison. If the agency accepts the case, the case will be assigned to the appropriate contract and worker. If the agency is unable to accept the case or if the case does not fit within the program requirements, the case will be rotated per the rules of the Cook County Case Assignment Protocol.</li><li><strong>Rotated Assignments</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li>Protective Custody- Immediate Placement<br>New cases of four or more siblings that are not appropriate for a Department contracted sibling program will be rotated per the rules of the Cook County Case Assignment Protocol. The assigned agency will be notified of assignment by CAPU staff, and will be expected to immediately identify placement for the siblings. Agencies will then take the following steps to place the children:<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman;\" type=\"i\"><li>Agencies must make efforts to identify a single placement for the entire sibling group, both within their own agency and other public and private Cook County providers.</li><li><p>&nbsp;If the agency is unable to immediately identify a single placement within their own system or through another provider, the agency must place the children in an appropriate emergency placement, and post the case on the Secondary Match System within <strong>five</strong> days of assignment.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the assigned agency to conduct a diligent search for a foster home for all siblings within 30 days of assignment, in compliance with DCFS Rule 301.70, and provide sibling contact and visitation in compliance with DCFS Rules 301.220 and 301.230.</p></li><li>When a placement is identified with another agency, case management responsibility will be transferred to the licensing agency unless the transfer is clinically contraindicated as determined by the Office of the Executive Deputy Director.</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to locate a placement for all siblings within 30 days, documentation of the diligent search and/or documentation of clinical reasons that prevent placement together must be submitted to the DCFS-Division of POS Monitoring.</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to provide sufficient documentation or demonstrate reasonable efforts within 30 days of assignment, the agency will maintain case management but will receive a contract deduction for inability to place.</li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Non-PC Cases- Disrupted Intact Cases</strong></p><p>The assignment of new child cases that were formerly served as intact family cases will follow the rules of the Cook County Case Assignment Protocol.</p><p>For cases in which protective custody has not been taken, and a court date is set for Temporary Custody (TC), the screening worker must submit all case opening information to CAPU prior to the TC hearing. The expectations of the assigned placement agency are as follows:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>The assigned placement agency is expected to identify an appropriate placement prior to TC and to attend the TC hearing, but becomes responsible at the point TC is granted.</li><li>Because the child(ren) do not require immediate placement, the assigned placement agency will be given twenty-four (24) hours to identify a single placement for the entire sibling group.</li><li>If the assigned agency cannot identify a single placement, within their own or another agency’s system, CAPU will reassign the case and the first agency will receive a contract deduction for inability to place.</li><li>When a placement is identified at another agency, case management responsibility will be transferred to the licensing agency, unless the transfer is clinically contraindicated as determined by the Office of the Executive Deputy Director.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>Add-on Sibling Assignment</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li><p><strong>Case Consolidation with a Single Agency</strong></p><p>When a new sibling case is opened, the case will be assigned per the rules of the Cook County Case Assignment Protocol.</p><ol><li>If only one agency is responsible for all sibling cases, the new child case will be assigned to the same agency. The agency must make all reasonable efforts to place the new child with a/all siblings.</li><li>If the sibling is placed apart, the assigned agency will provide for contact and visitation between the siblings in accordance with DCFS Rules 301.220 and 301.230.</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to place the new child with a/all siblings within 30 days, documentation of the diligent search and/or documentation of clinical reasons that prevent placement together must be submitted to the DCFS-Division of POS Monitoring.</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to provide sufficient documentation or demonstrate reasonable efforts within 30 days of assignment to place the new child with a/all siblings, the agency will maintain case management but will receive a contract deduction for inability to place.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Case Consolidation with Multiple Agencies</strong><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li>If multiple agency’s share case responsibility of open sibling cases, the new sibling case will be assigned per the rules of the Cook County Case Assignment Protocol.<br>When the identified agency is contacted by CAPU with the new child case, the agency will be expected to pursue placement of the new child with at least one sibling.</li><li><p>The initial agency must determine if they can place the new child with all/a sibling within one hour of assignment by CAPU. If a placement with a sibling is not possible, CAPU will contact the other agency(s) involved with the family in the following<br>order:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman;\" type=\"i\"><li>most siblings in any placement type.</li><li>most siblings in traditional (non-specialized) foster or home of relative.</li><li>any sibling in traditional (non-specialized) foster or home of relative.</li><li>sibling in any foster care placement type.</li></ol><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Children in non-foster care living arrangements, as verified by a current CFS 906 and in CYCIS, will not be considered when evaluating sibling placement together (i.e. Runaway, Detention, Department of Corrections, Institution, Group Home, Independent Living, Health Care Facility, Hospital, College, Armed Services Duty, or Emergency Shelters).</p></li><li>Each agency will be given one hour to respond to CAPU prior to CAPU contacting the next agency. If no involved agency is able to place the add-on child with a sibling, the assignment to the initial agency will stand.</li><li>The assigned agency must contact the sibling’s agencies(s) to plan a consolidated placement.</li><li>If the sibling is placed apart, the assigned agency will provide for contact and visitation between the siblings in accordance with DCFS Rules 301.220 and 301.230.</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to place the new child with a/all siblings within 30 days, documentation of the diligent search and/or documentation of clinical reasons that prevent placement together must be submitted to the DCFS-Division of POS Monitoring.</li><li>If the assigned agency is unable to provide sufficient documentation or demonstrate reasonable efforts within 30 days of assignment to place the new child with a/all siblings, the agency will maintain case management but will receive a contract deduction for inability to place.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>VI. COMPLIANCE</strong></p><p>The Department will closely monitor compliance with this and all other sibling protocols. Non-compliance with the Aristotle P. Consent Decree may result in Department imposed Corrective Action up to and including intake hold.</p><p><strong>VII.

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p><strong>I. Purpose</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to incorporate two Federal Title IV-E requirements into Department Permanency Planning policy. Title IV-E requires annual court findings of “reasonable efforts towards the permanency goal” and new findings of “contrary to the welfare of the child” and court findings of “reasonable efforts to prevent placement” when reunification (Trial Home Visit) fails. The phrase, “trial home visit” is federal terminology that describes a predominately downstate practice of sending children home while the Department retains legal custody of the child.</p><p><strong>II. Primary Users</strong></p><p>The primary users of this Policy Guide are Permanency Staff of DCFS and purchase of service agencies.</p><p><strong>III. Trial Home Visits</strong></p><p>A new court finding of “reasonable efforts to prevent placement” and “contrary to the welfare of the child” are necessary when the child returns to care after an extended “trial home visit” of more than six months, even if the court continued DCFS guardianship of the child during the trial home visit period.</p><p>“Trial home visit” is the term used in federal regulations for situations in which DCFS wards are returned home to their parents with DCFS guardianship continuing. If the “trial home visit” lasts for more than 6 months without a court order specifically indicating the trial home visit is to last longer, Federal regulations require that new findings must be made if those children re-enter care. The child’s removal must be treated as a new entry into foster care and eligibility for IV-E funds must be re-established, i.e. a court hearing must be held to determine that reasonable efforts have been made to eliminate the necessity of <strong>this</strong> removal and that remaining in the home any longer is contrary to the child’s welfare. Additionally, initial eligibility documents must be completed. The eligibility determination unit will need financial and deprivation information for the family as of the new entry date. Complete the Eligibility I &amp; II upon request. If the appropriate findings are not made when the child returns to care, that child will no longer be eligible for Title IV-E funds.</p><p>For example, if a child is placed in the home of parent (HMP) and after six months an issue arises in the home prompting the worker to remove the child, the case must be brought before the court for new findings of reasonable efforts and \"contrary to the welfare of the child\" even, though the Department retained legal custody. A new determination of Title IV-E eligibility will need to be made with new financial and removal information. Workers may be asked to complete the Eligibility I and II forms.</p><p><strong>IV. Permanency Hearings</strong></p><p>For title IV-E claiming, reasonable efforts towards achievement of the permanency goal must be documented at a permanency hearing at least annually after the initial reasonable efforts finding is made at the shelter care hearing. The finding concerning reasonable efforts to achieve permanency must be made as part of the permanency hearing order signed and dated by the judge. A copy of the order must be obtained and filed in Section IV of the case record, per Administrative Procedure #5, Appendix C –<br>Case Record Organization. Illinois law and Department Rule Section 316.120, Permanency Hearings requires these hearings every 6 months.</p><p><strong>V.

Filing Instructions</strong></p><p>File this Policy Guide behind page Rule 316 – (10) of Rule 316, Administrative Case Reviews and Court Hearings</p>\n  </div>"

      "htmlcontent": "<div class=\"wysiwyg-editor-text\">      <p><strong>I. Purpose</strong></p><p>The purpose of this Policy Guide is to implement revised procedures governing the request and approval of bed holds when children who are placed in a living arrangement (institution, group home, transitional living program, or independent living arrangement) are absent from their usual living arrangement due to certain reasons specified in this Policy Guide.</p><p><strong>Child Absences Covered by this Policy:</strong> Children covered by this policy include any child who is absent from his/her living arrangement due to: hospitalization for psychiatric or medical reasons: runaway; placement in a county-operated detention center; or admission to an inpatient alcohol or other drug abuse treatment program licensed by the Illinois Department of Human Services.</p><p><strong>Compliance with Other Controlling Policy and Procedures:</strong> Nothing in this policy relieves a caseworker of her/his responsibilities described in any other Department policy or established procedures concerning children who are psychiatrically hospitalized and procedures concerning children who are thought to have run away, been abducted and/or are missing. These absences must be reported within an hour to the Child Location Unit. Also, caseworkers are responsible for promptly reporting a child's absence from and return to the child's placement by contacting the appropriate downstate regional 906 Hotline or the Cook County Case Assignment and Placement Unit (CAPU) as required by Department procedures.</p><p><strong>Discharge of Children Who Are Absent from a Residential Care Placement:</strong> A provider of residential care services may unilaterally discharge a child who is absent from the residential care placement upon written notice to the assigned Department case worker. The provider will be paid for the last day the child was present in the residential care placement when there is an approved bed hold episode in effect on the date the provider notifies the Department of the child’s discharge from the residential care placement.</p><p>Additionally, a provider of residential care services who is determined by the Department to have a pattern of discharging children while children are absent from the placement may be subjected to a referral hold and/or an independent utilization review at the discretion of the Department.</p><p><strong>II. Primary Users:</strong> The primary users of this Policy Guide are caseworkers assigned to children who are placed in residential care, a transitional living program, an independent living arrangement, and staff members of the residential care placement, transitional living program, and independent living arrangement from which children are absent.</p><p><strong>III. Key Words</strong></p><p>Approved bed hold day, approved bed hold episode, psychiatric hospitalization, alcohol or other drug treatment, runaway, whereabouts unknown, reimbursement rates</p><p><strong>IV. Definitions</strong></p><p><strong>“Approved bed hold day”</strong> means a day during a child’s absence on which the provider provided one or more services to or on behalf of the absent child and the day on which the service was provided is within the period for which a bed hold has been approved in compliance with these procedures.</p><p><strong>“Approved bed hold episode”</strong> means a period of time that shall not exceed 30 consecutive days during which a child is absent from a living arrangement placement and for which the Department has approved payment to the provider for each day during the child’s absence on which the provider provided one or more services to or on behalf of the child and documented the provision of the service in the child’s treatment record. For the purpose of this Policy Guide, one approved bed hold episode may include a child experiencing more than one of the types of absences covered under the policy guide (e.g. runaway and detention) as long as the child does not return to the living arrangement placement at any time during the approved bed hold episode.</p><p>An approved bed hold episode begins on the date the child was first absent or two working days prior to the provider reporting the child’s absence to the appropriate downstate regional 906 Hotline or the Case Assignment and Placement Unit (CAPU) in Cook County, which ever is later.</p><p>An approved bed hold episode ends when one of the following events occurs:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;\" type=\"disc\"><li>The provider notifies the appropriate downstate regional 906 Hotline or the CAPU in Cook County that the child returned to the placement from which the child was absent; or</li><li>The child does not return and the provider notifies the assigned caseworker the child has been discharged from the living arrangement; or</li><li>The child returns but the assigned caseworker determines that it is not in the child’s best interest to return to the living arrangement from which the child was absent.</li></ul><p>Except as provided in Section VII, Exceptions, of this Policy Guide, an approved bed hold episode will be limited to a maximum of 30 consecutive days. The 30 days maximum begins on the date on which the child was first absent and ends 30 days later. However, payment for an approved bed hold episode that is approved pursuant to these procedures will begin on the date the child was first absent or two working days prior to the date on which the provider reported the child’s absent to the appropriate downstate regional 906 Hotline or the CAPU in Cook County, <strong>which ever is later</strong> and end no later than 30 days after the date on which the child was first absent.</p><p><strong>V. General Requirements</strong></p><p>A residential care, transitional living, or independent living provider must report a child’s absence from and return to the living arrangement to the appropriate downstate regional 906 Hotline or the Cook County CAPU within 48 hours (two working days) after the day on which the child was first absent. If the provider does not comply with the 48 hour (two working days) notification and if a bed hold episode is subsequently approved, the provider will receive payment beginning 48 hours (two working days) prior to the date the provider notified the Department of the child’s absence and ending on the last day of the approved bed hold episode or the date on which the child returns to the living arrangement, whichever is earlier. For example, the provider notifies the Department of a child’s absence 4 days (96 hours) after the child was first absent and returned to the placement 40 days later. A bed hold episode is subsequently approved. The approved bed hold episode is a maximum of 30 days from the date on which the child is first absent from the program; however, payment for the approved bed hold episode would be for a maximum of 28 days, as long as the provider complies with all the requirements of this Policy Guide.</p><p>Except as explained in Section VII, Exceptions, of this Policy Guide, a child must return to the provider from which the child was absent as a condition of payment for an approved bed hold episode. Additionally, the provider will ONLY receive payment for a day during an approved bed hold episode on which the provider provided one or more services to or on behalf of the child and the provision of service is documented in the child’s treatment record. Any day during an approved bed hold episode on which the provider provides NO service to or on behalf of the child will not be reimbursed.&nbsp;</p><p>All requests for bed hold payments must be submitted and approved on the <strong>CFS 906-5, Bed Hold Payment Request</strong>, that is an attachment to this Policy Guide.</p><p><strong>VI. Approval Procedures</strong></p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li><p><strong>Staffing</strong></p><p>Within 3 working days (72 hours) of the date on which a child is absent from her/his living arrangement because the child has run away, has been placed in detention by a judge, has been admitted to a hospital for psychiatric reasons, or has been hospitalized for medical reasons, there must be a case staffing involving, at a minimum, the Department or agency caseworker assigned to the child <strong>or</strong> the caseworker’s supervisor, and a representative of the provider who is knowledgeable about the clinical needs of the child. The purpose of the staffing is to determine whether it is in the best interest of the child to return to the living arrangement when the child returns from the absence. The staffing must be documented by the caseworker or by the caseworker’s supervisor on a <strong>CFS 492, Case Entry</strong> form or the appropriate contract case entry form and by the living arrangement provider in the child’s treatment record.</p><p>If the case staffing does not occur within 3 working days, no bed hold payment will be made without the approval of the Deputy Director of the Division of Placement/Permanency or the Division of Field Operations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Child Will Not Return to Previous Placement</strong></p><p>If it is determined by the staffing that it is not in the child’s best interest to return to the previous living arrangement, the provider shall complete the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> to document services provided to or on behalf of the child on each day on which the child was absent and the assigned caseworker or the caseworker’s supervisor will sign the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong>. The provider will fax the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> to the Department’s Central Office Client Payment Unit (CPU) at 217-557-0639. The CPU will compare the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> data to CYCIS information concerning the date on which the child’s absence was reported. The CPU will process a “<strong>case management only</strong>” payment in the amount of $ 19.04 per day for the dates on which the provider provided one or more services beginning on the date of the child’s absence or 48 hours (two working days) prior to the provider reporting the child’s absence, whichever is later, and ending on the date of the staffing at which it was determined that the child would NOT return to the previous living arrangement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Child Will Return to Previous Placement</strong></p><p>If it is determined by the staffing that it is in the best interest of a child to return from the absence to the previous placement, the following procedures apply:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>If the child returns to the provider before the 72 hour staffing, the provider shall promptly notify the appropriate downstate regional 906 Hotline or the Cook County CAPU of the child’s return. The provider shall also complete the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> to document what service was provided to or on behalf of the child each day during the child’s absence. The DCFS or agency caseworker and the caseworker’s supervisor shall sign and date the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong>. The provider will fax the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> to the Central Office Client Payment Unit (CPU) at 217-557-0639. The CPU will compare the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> data to CYCIS information concerning the date on which the child’s absence was reported. The CPU will process payment for the dates on which the provider provided one or more services beginning on the date of the child’s absence or 48 hours (two working days) prior to the provider reporting the child’s absence which ever is later and ending on the date that the child returned to the previous living arrangement.</li><li>If the child returns to the provider after the 72 hour staffing but before 30 consecutive days from the date on which the child was first absent, the provider shall promptly notify the appropriate downstate regional 906 Hotline or the Cook County CAPU of the child’s return. The provider shall also complete the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> to document what service was provided to or on behalf of the child each day during the child’s absence. The assigned DCFS or agency caseworker and the caseworker’s supervisor shall sign and date the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong>. The provider shall fax the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> to the Central Office Client Payment Unit (CPU) at 217-557-0639. The CPU will compare the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> data to CYCIS information concerning the respective dates on which the child’s absence and return were reported. The CPU will process payment for the dates on which the provider provided one or more services beginning on the date of the child’s absence or 48 hours (two working days) prior to the provider reporting the child’s absence, whichever is later, and ending on the date that the child returned to the previous living arrangement.</li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>VII. Exceptions</strong></p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:upper-latin;\" type=\"A\"><li><p><strong>No Staffing Occurs (Only in cases in which DCFS holds case management responsibility)</strong></p><p>If the assigned DCFS caseworker or the caseworker’s supervisor fails to participate in the staffing required by these procedures, the residential care, transitional living, or independent living provider shall, upon the child’s return, promptly notify the appropriate downstate regional 906 Hotline or the Cook CAPU of the child’s return. The provider shall also complete the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> to document what service was provided to or on behalf of the child each day during the child’s absence. At the bottom of the form in the space for the caseworker’s signature, the provider will write <strong>“DCFS caseworker and supervisor were contacted about the staffing and failed to participate in the required staffing.”</strong> A representative of the provider will then sign and date the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> in the space for the “supervisor’s signature.” A provider’s submittal of the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> in this circumstance is considered a statement of intent of the provider to accept the child back for care upon the child’s return from the absence.&nbsp;</p><p>The provider shall fax the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> to the Central Office Client Payment Unit (CPU) at 217-557-0639. CPU will compare the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> data to CYCIS information concerning the respective dates on which the child’s absence and return were reported. The CPU will process payment for the dates on which the provider provided one or more services beginning on the date of the absence or 48 hours (two working days) prior to the date the provider reported the child’s absence, whichever is later, and ending on the date that the child returned to the previous living arrangement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consecutive Approved Bed Hold Episode</strong></p><p>A consecutive bed hold episode may be approved by the Deputy Director of the Division of Placement/Permanency or the Deputy Director of the Division of Field Operations and only when a child is hospitalized for medical or psychiatric reasons or is detained in short-term incarceration (county operated detention facility), and:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>the child will return to the previous provider; and</li><li>the child’s discharge date is after the date on which the initial “approved bed hold episode” ends.</li></ol><p>The assigned DCFS or agency caseworker’s supervisor and the residential care, transitional living, or independent living provider must jointly request approval of a consecutive approved bed hold episode in writing via a decision memorandum to the Deputy Director of the Division of Placement/Permanency or the Deputy Director of the Division of Field Operations. The DCFS or agency supervisor and living arrangement provider must explain in detail why the consecutive approved bed hold episode is required and the date on which it is planned that the child will return to the previous placement.</p><p>The provider shall promptly notify the appropriate downstate regional 906 Hotline or the Cook County CAPU when the child returns to the previous living arrangement. The provider shall complete the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> to document what service was provided to or on behalf of the child each day during the child’s absence. The assigned DCFS or agency caseworker and the caseworker’s supervisor shall sign and date the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong>. The provider shall fax the <strong>CFS 906-5 AND</strong> a copy of the decision memo for the Deputy Director of the Division of Placement/Permanency or the Deputy Director of the Division of Field Operations to the Central Office Client Payment Unit (CPU) at 217-557-0639. The CPU will compare the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> data to CYCIS information concerning the respective dates on which the child’s absence and return were reported. CPU will forward the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> and decision memo to the Deputy Director for approval. If approved, CPU will process payment for the dates on which the provider provided one or more services beginning the first day of the absence or 48 hours (two working days) prior to the date the provider reported the child’s absence, whichever is later, and ending on the date that the child returned to the previous living arrangement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Child Does Not Return to Previous Living Arrangement As Planned</strong></p><p>If, based on the staffing required by these procedures, the intent was for a child to return to the previous living arrangement, but the supervisor of the assigned caseworker decides subsequently that it is NOT in the best interest of the child to return to the previous living arrangement, the supervisor shall, within one working day of the decision, notify the provider in writing that the child will not return to the placement. The date on the written notice will be the effective date of the child’s discharge from the living arrangement placement. The Department will pay the provider under this bed hold policy each day of a documented service up to the notification date of the child’s discharge from the living arrangement placement, not to exceed 30 days. Thereafter, if case management responsibility is retained by the living arrangement provider, the provider will need to request from the Department a <strong>“case management only”</strong> payment for each day the provider provided and documented one or more services to or on behalf of the child and remains the case manager of record. The provider shall complete the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> to document what service was provided to or on behalf of the child each day during the child’s absence. The assigned caseworker and the caseworker’s supervisor shall sign and date the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong>. The provider shall fax the <strong>CFS 906-5 AND a copy of the memorandum from the supervisor</strong> to the Central Office Payment Unit (CPU) at 217-557-0639. The CPU will compare the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> data to CYCIS information concerning the date on which the child’s absence was reported. The CPU will process the different payments, if appropriate, for the dates on which the provider provided one or more services beginning on the first day of the child’s absence or 48 hours (two working days) prior to the date the provider reported the child’s absence, whichever is later, and ending on the date of the notice from the caseworker to the provider that the child would not return to the provider and/or remained the case manager of record.</p></li></ol><p><strong>VIII. Reimbursement Rates for Approved Bed Hold Episode</strong></p><p>If an absent child <strong>does</strong> return to the previous placement, Medicaid-certified and non-Medicaid certified residential care providers will be reimbursed at the provider’s established per diem rate for each day within an approved bed hold episode on which the provider provides one or more services to or on behalf of the absent child as documented in the child’s treatment record and on the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong>.</p><p>If the child <strong>does NOT</strong> return to the previous living arrangement, the Department will pay the provider a “case management only” payment for each day during an approved bed hold episode that the provider provided one or more services to or on behalf of the absent child as documented in the child’s treatment record and on the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IX.

Formal policy of foster care bed holds will be forthcoming during this fiscal year.</li><li>If a pregnant or parenting teen is in a residential, independent living, transitional living, or group home setting, the bed hold policy applies.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How does the bed hold policy apply to ILO/TLP Programs in light of the Department runaway protocols?</strong></p><p>For the purpose of the bed hold policy and submittal of a <strong>CFS 906</strong>, a youth in ILO/TLP will be considered as continually in placement and not require special bed hold payment approval when absent from placement for 24 hours. The one hour guideline for initiating the runaway protocol should still be observed. If the child is absent for more than 24 hours, a CFS 906 should immediately be called in to the Case Assignment Placement Unit or the appropriate downstate regional 906 hotline effective the date of the run.</p></li><li><p><strong>If the private agency attempts to perform a service, such as an off-site visit to a detention facility, and the ward refuses to see them, can they put that down as a service since they did actually go to the facility and were unable to visit?</strong></p><p>Yes, as long as the agency documents the attempted contact in writing in the child’s treatment record or on a <strong>CFS 492, Case Entry</strong> form. The <strong>CFS 492</strong> should NOT be sent with the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> to the Central Office Client Payment Unit.</p></li><li><p><strong>In the past, the private agency claim voucher included any paid bed hold days. How does a provider reflect on the claim voucher the bed hold that hasn't been approved or entered on the system yet?</strong></p><p>In most cases an agency’s claim voucher will be submitted to the Department prior to the bed hold being approved and entered. The agency should submit the claim without the bed hold days. The agency will be paid for the actual placement days until the bed hold goes on. The bed hold days will no longer be required to be a part of the claim voucher process. Submission of the <strong>CFS 906-5</strong> and subsequent approval replaces the claim voucher process.</p></li><li><p><strong>What about a child who is absent from placement for reason of whereabouts unknown or abduction, the staffing occurs, and the intention is for the child to return to the same facility, but the child stays absent for an extended period of time (beyond 30 days). When should the agency send in its 906-5?</strong></p><p>The <strong>906-5</strong> should be submitted once the child has returned to the facility.</p><p>If the child is absent due to hospitalization for medical or psychiatric reasons or detention more than 30 days from the initial date of absence, a consecutive bed hold episode must be approved by the Deputy Director of the Division of Placement/Permanency or the Deputy Director of the Division of Field Operations (See Sec. VII. B. of the Policy Guide).</p></li><li><p><strong>What about a child who is absent from placement for reason of whereabouts unknown or abduction, the staffing occurs, and subsequently it is determined by the Department and the facility that the child will NOT be returned to the facility. When should the agency send in its 906-5?</strong></p><p>The <strong>906-5</strong> should be submitted immediately upon the determination that the child will not be returned to the facility. There has to be verification/documentation that the Department and the facility have jointly agreed that the child will not be returned.</p><p>The <strong>906-5</strong> should contain the signature of the DCFS or agency case manager or supervisor along with a signed memo indicating the date the decision was made for the child not to return</p></li><li><p><strong>What about a child who is absent from placement for reason of whereabouts unknown or abduction and the facility unilaterally decides that the child will be discharged. When should the agency send in its 906-5?</strong></p><p>Payment for a bed hold will NOT be made when a facility unilaterally decides to discharge a child, therefore a <strong>906-5</strong> should not be submitted.</p></li><li><p><strong>What if the service performed by the living arrangement staff doesn’t fit into any of the services listed on 906-5.</strong></p><p>The services listed on the <strong>906-5</strong> are Medicaid mental health services. When a non-Medicaid agency provides a service or when a Medicaid certified agency performs a non-Medicaid service, staff should choose the service that most closely reflects the task that was actually performed. If the task does not fit into the given services, call CPU at 1-800-525-0499 option 2.</p></li><li><p><strong>If a youth returns to the facility within 72 hours and prior to the completion of a staffing, does a staffing with DCFS still need to occur?</strong></p><p>Since the purpose of the staffing is to determine if it is in the child’s best interest to return to the living arrangement and the child has already returned to the living arrangement, a staffing need not be held. Procedures for this situation are found in Sec. VI. Part C. (Child Will Return to Previous Placement) of this Policy Guide.</p></li><li><p><strong>If a child is absent from placement for reasons of whereabouts unknown or abduction then returns in 25 hours, then leaves again for another 25 hours, how should this be reflected?</strong></p><p>When a child is gone for less than 72 hours and a staffing has not occurred and the facility performed services for any of the days of absence beyond the required notifications of the run protocol found in Rule Part 329, a <strong>906-5</strong> must be submitted reflecting the services in order to receive payment. If the child returns to the facility and then is absent again, each incident will be treated as a separate discrete absence.</p></li><li><p><strong>Are only business days counted when determining when the 72-hour staffing must occur?</strong></p><p>The staffing must take place within three State of Illinois working days.</p></li><li><p><strong>Does the facility fax the initial 906-5 to the Central Office Client Payment Unit (CPU) before the staffing has occurred, before services have been provided, or before the child has returned to the agency?</strong></p><p>The <strong>906-5</strong> will always be faxed to CPU <strong>after</strong> the services have been provided and <strong>after</strong> the child has been returned to the agency. If it is determined that the child will not be returned to the agency through the staffing, then a <strong>906-5</strong> can be completed and faxed to CPU because that agency is finished providing services to the child/family.</p><p>The <strong>906-5</strong> should contain the signature of the DCFS or agency case manager or supervisor along with a memo that the child is not returning.</p><p class=\"text-align-center\">OR</p><p>The <strong>906-5</strong> should be submitted along with a copy of the written notice to the assigned DCFS case manager that they are discharging the child from the facility.</p></li><li><p><strong>Can the facility fax a 72 hour staffing request to DCFS and will all DCFS staff agree to this? Or does the facility need to call to request the staffing?</strong></p><p>The facility should contact the appropriate DCFS staff via telephone or email in order to schedule a staffing. The agency may also fax a request; however, an agency should not rely ONLY on faxing since a worker or supervisor may inadvertently not receive the<br>request.</p></li><li><p><strong>Can the facility set or suggest the staffing time or do DCFS and the facility have to agree on a time (which could place agencies over the 72 hour limit at no fault of their own)?</strong></p><p>The facility can suggest a time for the staffing with DCFS, but the staffing will take place by mutual agreement. All parties should work together to ensure that the staffing takes place in a timely manner.</p></li><li><p><strong>Will an agency be paid for a bed hold if there are not any services identified on the CFS 906-5 form when submitted to CPU?</strong></p><p>An entry must be made for every day during which a service was performed. Only those days in which a service was performed are eligible for bed hold payments.</p></li></ol>\n  </div>"

PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The purposes of this Policy Guide are to clarify the circumstances under which the Department will approve and make payment to a Purchase of Service (POS) agency for Case Management Only Services (Type of Service Code 0118) and to replace Policy Guide 2002.15. Children placed in Independent Living situations and Transitional Living Programs (TLP) are covered by the Bed Hold Payments When Children are Absent from a Living Arrangement Policy Guide.</p><p><strong>II. PRIMARY USERS</strong></p><p>The primary users of this Policy Guide are DCFS and POS agency child welfare staff, DCFS regional contract staff, and DCFS financial payment staff.</p><p><strong>III. PAYMENT OF CASE MANAGEMENT ONLY SERVICES (Type of Service Code 0118)</strong></p><p>The Department of Children and Family Services only pays one agency at a time to provide case management services to a child for whom the agency is assigned case management responsibility. A case management only payment ($413.58 to a maximum of $516.98 depending on type of contract under which a child is being served) may be authorized to a private agency. The case management payment should be billed on a <strong>CFS 1042, Billing Summary,</strong> using Type of Service Code 0118.</p><p>Children placed in residential care, a group home, Transitional Living, or Independent Living programs are <strong>not</strong> covered by this Policy Guide. Existing Department policy and procedures governing the request and approval of bed holds should be followed for these types of placements.</p><p>The situations in which a case management payment may be authorized are as follows:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li>A child receiving specialized services who is placed with a caregiver who is receiving specialized payments directly from the Department (0114/0144 type service code) - The case management payment would be $516.98 prorated on a daily basis. <strong>Inclusion of this situation is intended primarily to address current arrangements. The Department expects in the future a limited number of situations in which a child receiving specialized services is placed with a caregiver who is receiving specialized payments directly from the Department and case management is assigned to a POS agency.</strong></li><li>A child absent from placement for reason of “whereabouts unknown” or “abduction”, who previously was in foster care assigned to a POS agency in a Downstate Performance Contract, Small Cook County Performance Contract, or Specialized Contract - Payment may be authorized for a maximum of 90 consecutive days, beginning the effective date of the absence from placement as entered on the <strong>CFS 906-1, Placement/Payment Authorization</strong>, at the applicable payment amount in note #1 based on the contract in which the child was being served prior to the absence from placement. The agency will continue aggressive efforts to locate the child under DCFS <strong>Procedures 329, Locating and Returning Missing, Runaway and Abducted Children and reporting to the Child Location Unit within an hour.</strong> Once located, even if beyond 90 days, the child will be assessed to determine if it’s in the child’s best interest to return to that agency.</li><li>A child hospitalized for medical reasons who, prior to hospitalization, was served in foster care assigned to a POS agency in a Downstate Performance Contract, Small Cook County Performance Contract or Specialized Contract - Payment may be authorized for all days of the hospital stay, beginning the effective date of the hospitalization as entered on the <strong>CFS 906-1</strong> at the applicable payment amount in note # 1 based on the contract in which the child was being served prior to the child’s admission to the hospital.</li><li>A child in a county – operated juvenile detention facility, a jail or committed to the Illinois Department of Corrections for less than 90 days who previously was in foster care assigned to an agency in a Downstate Performance Contract, Small Cook County Performance Contract or Specialized Contract - Payment may be authorized for all days of the detention stay up to 90 days, beginning with the effective date of the detention as entered on the <strong>CFS 906-1</strong> at the applicable payment amount in note # 1 in which the child was being served prior to the child’s placement in detention.</li><li>A child sentenced in a county-operated juvenile detention facility, a jail or committed to the Illinois Department of Corrections more than 90 days who previously was in foster care assigned to an agency in a Downstate Performance Contract, Small Cook County Performance Contract, or Specialized Contract - The child should be transferred back to the Department and payment will not be authorized for any days beyond 90. The POS agency must submit a copy of the <strong>CFS 1425</strong> with the <strong>CFS 1042</strong> to the Central Office Client Payment Unit (CPU), which demonstrates notification oftransfer to the Department has occurred. The CPU will notify the appropriate Downstate APT Supervisor or the Division of Monitoring/Quality Assurance when CYCIS reflects that a case has not been transferred back to the appropriate DCFS region according to the protocol described.</li><li>A child admitted to a hospital for psychiatric reasons and the child was served prior to admission in foster care by a POS agency in a Downstate Performance Contract, Small Cook County Performance Contract or Specialized Contract - Payment may be authorized for a maximum of 30 consecutive days, beginning the effective date of the psychiatric hospitalization as entered on the <strong>CFS 906-1</strong> at the applicable payment amount in note #1 for the contract in which the child was being served prior to the child’s admission to the hospital. The child’s case will NOT be transferred back to the Department even if the hospitalization is beyond 30 days.</li><li><p>A child admitted to a short-term residential drug or alcohol treatment facility who was served prior to admission in foster care by a POS agency in a Downstate Performance Contract, Small Cook County Performance Contract, or Specialized Contract - Payment may be authorized for a child in drug or alcohol treatment for a maximum of 90 consecutive days and the POS agency will maintain case responsibility, beginning the effective date of the short-term residential drug or alcohol treatment placement as entered on the <strong>CFS 906-1</strong> at the applicable payment amount in note # 1 for the contract in which the child was being served<br>prior to the child’s admission to the drug or alcohol treatment facility. The reason for placement “SAB” (child was placed in this setting because of his or her abuse of alcohol or drugs) should be used on the <strong>CFS 906</strong> when children are placed in these types of living arrangements.&nbsp;</p><p>If the drug or alcohol treatment stay is for more than 90 consecutive days, the child’s case should be transferred to the appropriate DCFS region. The POS agency shall retain case management responsibility until the case is transferred to the Department. The POS agency must submit a copy of the <strong>CFS 1425</strong> with the <strong>CFS 1042</strong> to the Central Office Client Payment Unit (CPU), which demonstrates notification of transfer to the Department has occurred. The CPU will notify the appropriate Downstate APT Supervisor or the Division of Monitoring/Quality Assurance when CYCIS reflects that a case has not been transferred back to the appropriate DCFS region according to the protocol described. The POS agency will be compensated for case management until the Department accepts the transfer.</p></li><li>Child in a foster home where the foster parents have requested no monthly foster care payments: payment to the POS agency should be authorized at a maximum rate of $413.58 per month prorated on a daily basis if the child is served in a Cook County contract or $516.98 per month prorated on a daily basis if the child is served under a downstate contract.</li><li>A youth 18 and over that has selected their own placement (see <strong>Procedures 301.60(d), Self-Selected Placements</strong>), should be transferred back to the Department with a current <strong>CFS 497, Client Service Plan</strong>, for emancipation of the youth and the status of the plan. Additionally, if the youth has a court hearing or Administrative Case Review (ACR) scheduled within 30 days of the case transfer, both the transferring worker and the receiving worker shall attend the court hearing and/or the ACR. The POS agency shall retain case management responsibility until the case is transferred to the Department. Payment may be authorized for all of the days of case management prior to the date on which the case is actually transferred in CYCIS at a maximum rate of $413.58 per month prorated on a daily basis. The POS agency must submit a copy of the <strong>CFS 1425</strong> with the <strong>CFS 1042</strong> to the Central Office Client Payment Unit (CPU) which demonstrates notification of transfer to the Department has occurred. The CPU will notify the appropriate Downstate APT Supervisor or the Division of Monitoring/Quality Assurance when CYCIS reflects that a case has not been transferred back to the appropriate DCFS region according to the protocol described.</li></ol><p><strong>Note # 1</strong>: Following is a listing of the monthly rates that will be used to determine the per diem payment for “case management only” under each of the listed types of contracts. These rates are subject to change if the contract rate changes in any given fiscal year:</p><ul class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:none;\" type=\"none\"><li><table><tbody><tr><td>Specialized Care Contracts</td><td>$516.98</td></tr><tr><td>Small Cook County Contract (PCS)</td><td>$413.58</td></tr><tr><td>Downstate Performance Contract (PCD)</td><td>$516.98</td></tr></tbody></table></li></ul><p>Case Management Only services (Type of Service 0118) will <strong>NOT</strong> be approved for a child served under a Cook County Relative/Traditional Performance contract in any of the situations described above as the BAFC payment includes payment for case management services in the above described situations.</p><p><strong>Note #2</strong>: A child admitted and sentenced for more than 90 days to the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) and placed in an IDOC juvenile or adult correctional facility who previously was in foster care assigned to an agency in their Downstate Performance Contract, Small Cook County Performance Contract, Specialized Contract, Independent Living Contract or Transitional Living Contract should be transferred to the appropriate DCFS region immediately and will not receive any reimbursement.</p><p><strong>Note #3</strong>: Availability of case management only services (type service code 0118) for youth participating in the Youth in College Program, the Scholarship program, the Youth in Employment or the Youth in Vocation program will be clarified at a later date. The agency should immediately initiate steps to transfer the child’s case to DCFS.</p><p><strong>IV. EXCEPTIONS</strong></p><p>Payment for exceptions to this Policy Guide will be considered if appropriate documentation of the reason for the exception is sent to the Central Office Client Payment Unit.</p><p><strong>V. BILLING PROCEDURES</strong></p><p>Approval and entry of valid 0118 bills should follow this process:</p><ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:lower-latin;\" type=\"a\"><li>The regional contract office receives a <strong>CFS 1042</strong> billing from the provider. The region determines that the bill is a valid bill and that the services listed have been delivered. The appropriate staff sign off on the billing as receiving officer.</li><li>The regional staff attaches a cover sheet to the <strong>CFS 1042</strong> indicating the name, address and phone number of the regional staff person to be contacted with any questions regarding the billing.</li><li>The regional office staff sends the billing to Central Office Client Payment Unit (CPU), Department of Children and Family Services, 406 East Monroe Street – Station #438, Springfield, Illinois 62701 for further review of the billings.</li><li>The Central Office Client Payment Unit approves or denies the bill.<ol class=\"ckeditor-list-type-attribute\" style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\" type=\"1\"><li>Approved – CPU initials the bill (partial or entire) and verifies that the 0118 type service code and rate is in the provider’s contract. If not, CPU notifies the Office of Contract Administration (OCA) to complete the process for adding the need for the rate to be included in the appropriate contract.</li><li>Denied – CPU sends the bill (partial or entire) back to the region with notification regarding the reason for denial.</li></ol></li><li>OCA completes entry of rates and funding to the appropriate contract and notifies CPU when completed.
